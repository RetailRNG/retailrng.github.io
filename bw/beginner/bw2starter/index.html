<p>This Guide will teach you how to <strong>RNG manipulate for a shiny Starter
Pokemon in Pokemon Black 2 and White 2</strong>. The BW2 starter is probably
the single most annoying RNG manipulation in all of BW2 due to the lack
of tools ingame that early on in your adventure, the 2 randomly moving
NPCs that are loaded in and advancing the RNG by varying amounts and the
Timer0 being much more volatile in BW2 compared to BW1. This means it'll
most likely take at least a dozen, possibly a fair lot more attempts to
get. To be able to RNG manipulate it, <strong>you need to have done both
<a href="/bw/beginner/calibration">Profile Calibration</a>
and <a href="https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/bw2starter/tidsid/">TID/SID RNG</a></strong> already. I will be using my English copy of
Black 2 for this guide.</p>
<h4 id="hardware-requirements"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#hardware-requirements" aria-label="Anchor link for: hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A BW2 game and a DS Console you have calibrated for Gen 5 RNG
Manipulation and a savefile that you RNG manipulated a TID/SID pair
on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
or QT 6.8 or newer</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Be saved right in front of Bianca at the outlook in Aspertia City
(Bianca has 2 dialogues up there; in the first she asks you a few
questions such as whether you will help to complete the Pokedex. You
need to save after that first dialogue which is just before you can
take your Starter).</li>

<p>Otherwise you'll want to start by <strong>opening up Pokefinder</strong>, going to
the <strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there opening the <strong>Static option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="PokeFinder main window" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage2.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the <strong>profile</strong> of the
game you wish to do this in <strong>is selected</strong> and right below the profile
option <strong>switch to the searcher tab</strong> in which there's 3 different
sections labeled &quot;<strong>RNG Info</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Settings</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Filters</strong>&quot;.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage11.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In the <strong>RNG Info section</strong>, <strong>leave the Initial IV Advances, Max IV
Advances and Lucky Power all at 0</strong>. The <strong>Initial Advances</strong> you want to
<strong>put to 4</strong> and the <strong>Max Advances to 0</strong>. This way PokeFinder will
only search for targets that are <strong>exactly 4 Advances in</strong>. This is
important as there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in when you're
standing in front of Bianca. Those NPCs will advance the RNG by 4 most
often before you can take the Starter (if you're as fast as you can be).
Generally it can be any amount between like 0-6, but 4 is the most
common whilst the ones further out like 0 and 6 are extremely rare. </p>
<p>The
<strong>date range</strong> you choose will depend on whether you want the Starter to
just be shiny or have a few perfect IVs too and whether you care about
its met date. If you just care for a shiny, possibly with a specific
Nature and Gender, <strong>searching through just 1 day</strong> (perhaps whatever
your &quot;today&quot; is when reading this) will give you several possible
targets to go for already. <strong>If you want some perfect IVs as well,</strong>
you'll have to either <strong>change the advance range you search through</strong>
(searching through <strong>3-5 advances aka with an Initial Advance of 3 and
Max Advances of 2 so 3+2=5 is still reasonable enough</strong> but I would
highly advise against expanding the range further), <strong>increase the date
range</strong> or <strong>enable more Keypresses</strong> in your profile. </p>
<p>I <strong>do NOT</strong>
recommend trying to <strong>find a 4-6IV target seed this way</strong>, as it will
require you to search through several months to maybe even years; <strong>if
you want such high IVs + shiny</strong>, best to <strong>prepare for that</strong> already
<strong>as explained in the TID/SID RNG guide</strong>. Since I will just go for a
shiny with a specific Gender and Nature right now, I put my Max Advances
to 0 and the date range to just search through the current day as of
writing this guide, which is the 21st of August 2025. If you also only
care to get a shiny without any specific IVs, you can disable all but
&quot;None&quot;, &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; Keypresses in your profile for comfort.</p>
<p>Next in the <strong>Settings section</strong>, <strong>select the</strong> <strong>Starters Category</strong>
with the Starter you wish to RNG and finally in the <strong>Filters section</strong>
<strong>input your desired IVs, Gender, Nature and whether you want a shiny or
not</strong>.</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: What are Star and Square shinies? </summary>
<p>Star and Square shinies are
ONLY differentiated in Pokemon Sword and Shield specifically by having
different shiny sparkles when sent out into battle. If you either don't
plan to transfer this Pokemon at all or intend to transfer it to
literally any other game (all of Gens 6, 7 and 9 + BDSP, Legends: Arceus
and Legends: Z-A), this difference does not exist.</p>
</details>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Settings for Pokefinder search" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage9.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you can hit the <strong>Search button</strong> and once PokeFinder has found a
result you're happy with you can cancel the search if it's not done
already. If you get no results or none you're satisfied with you can
either search through a different date range (e.g. the full current
month), increase the Max Advances or select more possible Keypresses in
your profile (do not use 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 Keypresses for this specific
RNG. We will later need to use the Profile Calibrator for assistance and
it can only take up to 3 different Keypresses at a time).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="PokeFinder settings" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage18.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>I will pick this marked Naive Male Oshawott seed here on the 21st of
August 2025 at 21:16:20 because its target second in 20 is the most
comfortable one for me to aim for here since I'm playing on a DS Phat
(same would apply to the DS Lite and DSi; on 3DS going for something
between like 40-55 target seconds would be most comfortable, a fairly
fast target second matters a bit more for this RNG than it does for
other RNGs as you'll likely have to do quite a lot of attempts before
getting the shiny. </p>
<p>So taking a target second that would have you wait
very long before even getting into the game will add up over time).
There's also 2 Keypresses in the Select button and the Up direction on
the D-pad that I'll have to press and hold during startup of the game.</p>
<h2 id="the-rng-process"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-rng-process" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-rng-process">The RNG Process</a></h2>
<p>Open up <strong>EonTimer</strong> and there <strong>put the Target Second to your seeds
seconds</strong> (20 in my case), <strong>go into the DS menu to change the date to
the target date</strong> (here the 21st of August 2025) <strong>and get ready to
change and confirm the target time</strong> (21:16 for me; should EonTimer say
&quot;<strong>Minutes Before Target: 1</strong>&quot; and your target time is e.g. 12:30:05,
you'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Eontimer setup" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage10.png" width="60%"></center>
<div class="tabcontainer" num="1">
<div class="tab">

  <button class="tablinks"         onclick="openCity(event, 3, 1)">3DS</button>

<div id="1" class="tabcontent active">

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>At the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,
press the Start button in EonTimer</strong>. Now go back to the home menu, get
ready to <strong>start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer
sounds</strong> and make sure to <strong>press and hold any buttons your target seed
may require</strong> (start pressing the buttons right after you started the
game and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will
need to press and hold the Select button and the Up direction on the
D-pad).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="When you can press A" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage4.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now continue getting into the game. <strong>Once you click continue on the
savefile selection screen</strong>, immediately <strong>start spamming the A button</strong>
to make the season showing screen fade faster. This is important as the
randomly moving NPCs that are loaded in can already start moving and
thus advance the RNG whilst the game is showing you the current season.
Now <strong>keep spamming the A button and take</strong> <strong>your Starter as quickly as
possible</strong> (as soon as Bianca's textboxes start, the NPCs will no longer
be able to move). If you're lucky, you will have the shiny Starter of
your dreams now, in which case you <strong>can skip to the &quot;Next Steps...&quot;
section</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-label="Anchor link for: troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If your Starter did not shine, which is fairly likely in BW2 due to the
NPCs and inconsistent Timer0, <strong>double check all date and time
settings</strong> match your target, <strong>make sure you accounted for any minutes
before target</strong> if EonTimer tells you you need them and <strong>check if all
the buttons</strong> you may need to press and hold <strong>are working properly</strong>.
If you found an error, try again with it fixed. If you found nothing or
it also didn't shine after the fix, which is still fairly likely, you'll
now need to figure out whether you're just getting Timer0'd (aka the
game did not &quot;give&quot; you your most common Timer0 yet) or whether the NPCs
are interfering with you getting the shiny. To check this, <strong>you'll need
to calculate the IVs of the Starters you get.</strong></p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Selected starter" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage17.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Open up the <strong>IV calculator</strong>, <strong>select the generation 5 games</strong> and
<strong>select the Pokemon</strong> you're going for.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="IV Calculator" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage5.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now after a Starter RNG attempt, input its <strong>Nature</strong>,
<strong>Characteristics</strong>, <strong>Level</strong> and <strong>Stats</strong> and then press the <strong>Find
IVs</strong> button; the resulting IV ranges will appear in the bottom right of
the IV Calculator.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were
changed in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for
these, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar
issue but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's
Characteristics change so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you
may have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokemon wiki site of
your language for example.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage1.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>You can change the language of PokeFinder to whatever language your game
is in by going to Tools and then Settings in the main window and it'll
display that language's names for all the Natures and Characteristics.</p>
<p>Now <strong>compare the IVs</strong> of the Starter <strong>you got</strong> <strong>with the IVs</strong> of
the Starter <strong>you were</strong> <strong>aiming for</strong> in the searcher tab (ignore the
Nature; it can change depending on how much the NPCs advanced by, whilst
the IVs will ALWAYS stay the exact same as long as you hit your target
seed. The Characteristics will usually be the same however if your
target has 2 or more stats that both have the same equally highest IV
(e.g. if your HP and Attack IV both were 31), the Characteristics can be
either the one for 31 HP or the one for 31 Atk; it'll be different from
advance to advance). For optimal speed, start by comparing the IV that
your latest Starters Characteristics was linked to, which is always the
one with a few specific options that are divided by commas in the IV
Calculator's results.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Starters summary" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage15.png" width="60%"></center>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="IV Calibration" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage13.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In my case the latest Oshawott had a SpAtk Characteristics that,
together with all the other IV ranges, gave me the information that the
SpAtk must be either 14, 19, 24 or 29. Since my target seeds SpAtk IV is
6, I already know I did not hit my target seed. So now I will simply
<strong>go back to the console's date and time settings and start the next
RNG attempt</strong>.</p>
<p>But what to do if the IVs matched perfectly?</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Starters Summary" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage7.png" width="60%"></center>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Exact IV match" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage16.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>On my 5th attempt I got <strong>this Oshawott whose calculated IV ranges match
the IVs of my target,</strong> so I can assume that <strong>I</strong> most likely <strong>hit my
target</strong> Timer0 and with that my target <strong>seed</strong>. Since it wasn't shiny,
the NPCs did not advance the RNG by 4 this time and <strong>if I were to just
try again</strong>, <strong>they</strong> would advance the exact same amount again as well
<strong>leading to me never getting the shiny</strong>. We can <strong>get around this by
understanding how NPC movement works</strong>. Their movement is determined by
2 things: the current RNG state (the seed and its advances) and <strong>their
last saved position</strong> (if they are already loaded in which they are when
standing next to Bianca). </p>
<p>Since it would be quite annoying to have to
find a new seed every time we run into this problem, we don't wanna
change that part. But <strong>their last saved position is something we can
easily influence</strong>. To change it, <strong>simply get into the game</strong> normally
without RNG (you can do with RNG but its a waste of time for this),
<strong>stand idly next to Bianca for a few seconds</strong> (doesn't matter whether
you're in front, left of or right of her; 5-10 seconds is plenty the
time waited doesn't matter much) <strong>and then save the game</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to save" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage3.png" width="40%"></center>
<p><strong>This will reposition the NPCs</strong> and make it so that next time they
have a fairly good chance of advancing the RNG differently than last
attempt. Repositioning the NPCs this way is only useful whenever you hit
your target seed, which is why we wanna calculate the IVs every attempt.</p>
<p>Keep on checking the IVs and reposition the NPCs whenever needed until
you get your shiny! <strong>Should it still not have shined after 30 attempts
and you do not seem to hit your target seed much or at all</strong>, start an
RNG attempt but instead of getting into the game and taking the Starter,
<strong>do 1 Profile Calibration attempt</strong> as explained in the Unova Link
Needle Calibration section of the <a href="/bw/beginner/calibration">Profile Calibration Guide</a>. </p>
<p>If the result of the Profile Calibration attempt matches your target
second (or is very closeby; it being 1 too high or low is fairly common
on 3DS models specifically), but has a different Timer0, you seem to be
getting Timer0'd aka the game mostly gives you your other Timer0s. In
that case you can choose between continuing to try as you will get it
eventually (though it may take a while if you continue being unlucky) or
trying out a different target seed for your Starter, as some
date/time/Keypress combinations may have your usually less common
Timer0s be much more common, making this RNG take much longer than
normal.</p>
<p>Should you however get no results at all, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy ._.</em>'s RNG
manip assistance Discord server</a>
and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation of
the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder Static and
Calibration windows and EonTimer</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="shini get :)" src="/bw/beginner/bw2starterimage6.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>After about 17 attempts and repositioning the NPCs 4 times, I got my
shiny Oshawott!</p>
<h2 id="next-steps"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Anchor link for: next-steps">Next Steps...</a></h2>
