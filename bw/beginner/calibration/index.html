<p><strong>Calibrating your game is the mandatory first step for any Gen 5 RNG
Manipulation</strong>. Calibrating in this context means finding certain values
that are tied to 1 specific combination of game cartridge + a DS console
(specifically the console's Motherboard and Wifi Board). So if you e.g.
have a Pokemon White Version, a Pokemon Black Version, a Pink Nintendo
DS Lite and a Blue Nintendo 3DS and you calibrate your White Version +
the Pink DS Lite, you will have ONLY found the calibration for that
specific cartridge + console combination. If you now wish to RNG with
your White Version on the Blue 3DS or with your Black version on either
of the two DS Consoles, you will need to calibrate those specific
combinations as well.</p>
<p>With your White Version + Pink DS Lite calibrated, you could RNG a few
Pokemon and then e.g. just continue to play your adventure normally on
your Blue 3DS if you wanted to. If you then switch back to the Pink DS
Lite, you will not need to calibrate again as the calibration does not
change. It is also not tied to your savefile in any way so if you delete
the savefile you originally calibrated with, the calibration will remain
exactly the same on any new one.</p>
<p><strong>The Process is almost exactly the same no matter what model DS console
you're using</strong>, however there's some small but important differences
I'll explain later. The most noteworthy difference is that the (New) 3DS
(XL) and (New) 2DS (XL) both take longer to boot up DS games and take a
varying amount of time making you miss your targeted time by a second or
two every now and then. If you have a DS, Lite, or i at your disposal, I
recommend you do Gen 5 RNG on that. But if you don't have one, using a
3DS line model will work as well no problem.</p>
<details class="md-details">
  <summary class="md-details-summary">Note: New research regarding 3DS second inconsistency.</summary>
  <p>New research suggests that the reason for the second you hit being so inconsistent on
3DS models is due to the console not resetting its hidden millisecond
timer when the user changes date or time whereas the DS and DSi did
reset it. In the future timer tools may have a metronome feature or
something similar that may help make it significantly more consistent.
Though the loading times will still be much longer and therefore you
will still often have to wait longer on an RNG attempt before you can
enter the game compared to playing on a DS, Lite or i.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>This Guide will likely only work for you if you have an original copy
of a gen 5 game</strong> as ROMs played via Twilight Menu or NDS forwarder and
fake cartridges calculate these values we're trying to figure out in a
different, largely unknown way, making it much more difficult or often
even impossible to calibrate.</p>
<p>The values we're looking to find using this calibration process are
called the <strong>VCount</strong>, <strong>Timer0</strong>, <strong>VFrame</strong> and <strong>GxStat</strong>.</p>
<p>Whilst the <strong>VCount</strong>, <strong>VFrame</strong> and <strong>GxStat</strong> always <strong>stay
consistent</strong> throughout this calibration process (so you can get only 1
specific value for each of those), <strong>the Timer0 varies</strong> between a
limited number of values. Which Timer0 you get exactly is random every
time you start the game or soft reset, though for RNG Manip in
Generation 5, we want to stay away from soft resetting for now as the
current RNG programs cannot account for that. How many different
Timer0's you can get here depends on both the game you're playing and
the console you're playing on.</p>
<p>Here we have the first difference between BW1 and BW2.</p>
<p><strong>In Black and White 1 you can always get exactly 2 different</strong>,
numerically adjacent <strong>Timer0 values</strong>. If one of your Timer0's is 1110
for example, the other Timer0 you can get must either be 110F or 1111.
The F can be here because these are hexadecimal numbers, meaning instead
of counting from 0-9 and then going over to the next 10th, this system
counts from 0-9 and then A-F so there's 16 different values possible
instead of only 10 going 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F,
10, 11, [...]. Which of the other two Timer0 values it actually is
you may find out during this calibration process, but even if you don't
that's fine, as in that case it would be your lesser common Timer0
value which you generally wouldn't want to use for RNG Manipulation.
Should both the Timer0 values you find be evenly split in how often you
got them, you can either just choose one at random to RNG with in the
future or input both of them into your RNG profile to use both for RNG
manipulation; whichever you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>In Black and White 2 however you can get more than just 2 Timer0's</strong>
making RNG there more inconsistent than it is in BW1, but in exchange
BW2 have other advantages such as more varied wild and static encounters
to choose from and much better methods for advancing the RNG quickly.
From my experience I've found that there's 3 different ways the Timer0
can be distributed for a given console+cartridge combination in BW2:</p>
<p>1. The standard distribution:<br />
Here you'll have between ~6-8 Timer0's, 1-2 of which are a fair bit
more common than the rest. This one is by far the most common and it
<strong>is the only Timer0 distribution you can get if you're playing on a DS
or DS lite</strong> though it <strong>is also most common on DSi and 3DS models</strong>.</p>
<p>2. The lucky distribution:<br />
With this one you'll only hit 1 or 2 specific Timer0's about 90% of the
time, making hitting the Timer0 you are aiming for almost as quick as it
is in BW1. <strong>This distribution can ONLY exist on DSi and 3DS</strong> and is
pretty rare.</p>
<p>3. The unlucky distribution:<br />
This is by far the worst one as you can get between ~10-20 or possibly
even more different Timer0's, none of which are particularly more common
than the rest. If this is the Timer0 distribution you got, RNG
manipulation will be VERY annoying and honestly I wouldn't torture
myself with that. If you have ANY other console than the one you got
this unlucky distribution with, even if it is the exact same model, I
still recommend to try calibration on that one as well as there's a
chance you will get a standard or maybe even lucky Timer0 distribution
there. <strong>This distribution can also ONLY exist on DSi and 3DS</strong> and is
pretty rare too.</p>

<p>Which target second you pick generally doesn't matter however I've
chosen 20 and 40 respectively so you will (almost) always have enough
time to get back to the home menu after changing your ds console's time,
but also don't have to wait unnecessarily long. The calibration is more
important to be at the recommended values here, however they won't work
perfectly for everyone and I'll explain later how to adjust it for
yourself if needed.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>This method <strong>can be used in both BW1 and BW2, <em>but if you are playing
BW2, go to the Unova Link Needle Calibration Tab</em></strong> to not waste your
own time. There are also some BW2 exclusive specifications that I will
not mention in this Save Needle Calibration tab, but only in the Unova
Link Needle Calibration and IV Calibration tabs.</p>
<p>I will be using my German White 1 game together with my Nintendo 3DS
console for this example.</p>
<p><strong>Before you start</strong> you need to <strong>move your player character to a
silent location</strong> that doesn't have anything that can advance the RNG on
its own, then save the game. <strong>Your character's home room is
recommended</strong> here as it's the first accessible location when starting a
new savefile.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Bedroom BW1" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage29.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>You also have to <strong>make sure that Tornadus or Thundurus are NOT actively
roaming throughout the Unova region</strong> in your game as that will advance
the RNG whenever you boot up the game by a bit and make Save Needle
Calibration impossible.</p>
<p>If you're far enough into the game to activate the roamer, which is
after the 7th gym, and are unsure whether your Tornadus or Thundurus is
currently roaming, you can check a gate's electronic bulletin board for
news about a storm (GIF displays Thundurus' message; Tornadus is a bit
different).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Bulletin Board for where roamer is" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage49.gif" width="60%"></center>
<p>If it is indeed roaming, it would be fastest to just encounter and kill
it; it'll respawn after you beat the champion again. Should you for some
reason not be willing to kill or capture it, you'll have to use the IV
calibration method. It is unaffected by the roamer and will allow you to
successfully calibrate.</p>
<p>To start the Save Needle Calibration, you <strong>open up PokéFinder</strong>, go to
<strong>Gen 5 Tools</strong> at the top and open up the <strong>Profile Calibrator</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Profile Calibrator PokeFinder" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage45.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the left half of the window, switch over to the <strong>Needle Search
tab</strong>, select the <strong>Saving option</strong> and <strong>input the date and time</strong> you
wish to use for this. I'll just put it to the 23rd of May 2025, 15:00
(aka 3pm) because that's the current date and time whilst I'm writing
this guide.</p>
<p>Then in the right half you start by selecting the <strong>game version</strong>,
<strong>language</strong>, <strong>console you play on</strong> and <strong>add your console's MAC
address</strong> which can be found in the internet settings.</p>
<p>On DS and DS lite you need to access it from within the games menu and
on DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard wifi
settings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS/2DS).
If your MAC address starts with one or multiple 0's, those will
automatically be omitted by PokéFinder (e.g. a MAC address like
00-08-53-30-64-90 would become 853306490).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Mac Address Locations" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage37.png" width="100%"></center>
<p><strong>Set the seconds</strong> Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -5 and
+5. So if you're <strong>on 3DS line models</strong> and used my recommended seconds,
put it <strong>to Min 35 and Max 45</strong> and <strong>on DS, Lite or i to Min 15 and Max
25</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Profile Calibration setup window" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage48.png" width="90%"></center>
<p>Everything else you'll want to leave as it is by default (if you
accidentally change something else you can always just change game
version and then change back to reset to the default values).</p>
<p>Note: (The Soft Reset checkbox.) The <strong>Soft Reset checkbox</strong> is
currently <strong>not working</strong> properly so don't use it.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h2>
<p>That finishes the PokéFinder setup; now you can start the first
calibration attempt.</p>
<p>For that you go to your console's settings and change the date to match
whichever date you put into the PokéFinder calibration window. Next you
go to the time settings and change the time according to the calibration
window as well, but <strong>at the same moment that you confirm the time
change, you start EonTimer</strong> by clicking the Start button.</p>
<div class="tabcontainer" num="1">
<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active"  onclick="openCity(event, 1, 1)" >DS</button>
  <button class="tablinks"         onclick="openCity(event, 2, 1)">3DS</button>
</div>
<div id="1" class="tabcontent active">

</div>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My Eontimer set up for 3DS" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage25.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now you go back to the home menu (on DSi and 3DS line models you can
either navigate back through the settings or use the Power Button to get
back whilst on DS and Lite you have to shut off the console and turn it
back on after).</p>
<p>Once there you wait for the timer to run out and <strong>on the 6th and final
beep of EonTimer you start the game</strong>. Make sure <strong>not to press any
buttons in between you starting the game and the star appearing on the
top screen</strong>, since that will change the seed you're on and just add an
unnecessary extra step to this.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Star just fading in on White 1" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage15.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Once you see this star, you may start pressing buttons and get into the
game. If you're far enough into the story to have received the
<strong>C-Gear</strong>, you <strong>must deactivate</strong> it upon entering the game as it
would otherwise advance the RNG and make calibration impossible.</p>
<p>With this being the Save Needle Calibration method, we will make use of
the clock symbol that appears whenever you save the game; the position
the clock's hand starts at when saving is what you need to pay attention
to.</p>
<p>Here's a GIF of the first needle I got during this calibration followed
by a picture of the starting position:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="What the save spinner looks like in action" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage55.gif" width="60%"></center>
<br>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Starting position of first save" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage53.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>As you can see, the first needle starting position I got is a bottom
left ↙ needle, which I add into PokéFinder's calibration window by
clicking on the bottom left needle button.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Inputting the first spinner" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage36.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>Now we continue on saving the game again until we have the <strong>starting
position of 8 needles in a row</strong>. If you didn't see one of the needles
starting positions, you cannot continue and have to go back to the home
menu to try again, beginning with changing the time back and starting
EonTimer.</p>
<p>Once you are done with the 8 needles, press the <strong>Search button</strong> and
see what result PokéFinder gives you.</p>
<p>In my case I got the following result:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Result after 8 spins" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage8.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>There's a few things to watch out for here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your results Seconds value does not match your EonTimer's target
second, make sure it's not too far off. On DS, lite and i, the
second should never be off by more than 2. Being off by 1 is already
rare and being off by 2 near impossible but both have happened to
people in the past. On 3DS line models being off by 1 or 2 is fairly
common due to the console having an inconsistent bootup time for DS
games. Being off by 3 may also be possible in rare cases, but if you
get a result that's 4 or more seconds off, it's most likely an
invalid result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you get more than 1 result you can simply add a 9th needle
and press <strong>Search</strong> again and if that still isn't enough to narrow
it down to 1, add a 10th etc until you're at exactly 1 result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get no results at all or only get results that are too far
off from your target second, make sure all the values in your
PokéFinder and EonTimer are correct and match what's on your DS
console (date, time, MAC address, game version, language, DS type,
saving option selected and EonTimer calibration). Then just do
another attempt. Should you get 0 results again, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy
._.</em>'s RNG manip assistance Discord server</a>
and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation
of the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder
Calibration window and EonTimer</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The result I got here looks good though as it's the only one and the
second I hit is 2 off from my target which is normal on 3DS. In the
future however when we get to actually RNGing e.g. a Shiny Pokemon, we
will need to hit the exact target second and not 1-2 seconds late or
early. For this we need to adjust EonTimer so that, in my example, I can
hopefully hit the 40 seconds next attempt. To adjust EonTimer you simply
take the second you hit instead of your target (42 for me instead of
40), put it into the <strong>Second Hit field</strong> and press the <strong>Update
button</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Updating Eontimer" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage5.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>This will change your <strong>Calibration</strong> value so that next time you'll be
more likely to hit your actual target second.</p>
<p>After this first attempt we will now write down the values we got
somewhere (e.g. a standard text file):</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Timer0 results" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage16.png" width="40%"></center>
<h2 id="further-attempts">Further Attempts</h2>
<p>Now you'll want to do between <strong>4-9 more such calibrations for a total
of 5-10 attempts</strong> to <strong>find</strong> what <strong>your most common Timer0</strong> value
is. This is important because later when you're trying to RNG e.g. a
Shiny, you will want the highest chances of hitting your target Timer0.
If you were to only do 1 single calibration for example you may have
just had bad luck and hit a Timer0 that, on average, you'd only get
about 10% of the time which also means you'd miss your target about 90%
of the time. Some date/time combinations may have one Timer0 be much
more common than it would be on most other date/time combinations. To
prevent this from giving you a Timer0, that on most other date/time
combinations you would barely ever hit, I recommend to <strong>change the
target time just a little bit after every calibration attempt</strong>. In my
example I'll just put the clock in both PokéFinder and on my DS console
forward by 1 minute each attempt so on attempt 2 I will target
15:01/3:01 pm, on attempt 3 15:02/3:02 pm and so on.</p>
<p>If even after adjusting EonTimer you still keep hitting 1-2 above or
below your target second most of the time, don't keep adjusting every
single attempt. Instead write down which second you hit every time, and
then at the end of the 5-10 attempts, take the average, round it up/down
and then use that average second hit to adjust your EonTimer. Especially
on 3DS models you will most likely continue to not always hit your
target second due to the varying loading times of those models.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-profile">Creating a Profile</h2>
<p>At the end of my 10 calibrations, my Timer0 distribution looked like
this:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Results after 8 attempts" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage18.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>I hit 125f 2 times and 1260 8 times. Now in the PokéFinder calibration
window we can right click into the last result we got, making a small
popup window appear, and there we select the <strong>Create profile</strong> option.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Create profile from results" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage39.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>A smaller window will pop up with all the latest results' values and
your game version, language, console type and MAC address already filled
out. If your latest attempt resulted in your less common Timer0, you may
want to change both the Min Timer0 and the Max Timer0 to your more
common value.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Prfoile editor gen 5" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage21.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you just input a name for the profile into the name field (I named
mine W1 3DS CC because it's for my Pokemon White 1 on my Capture Card
3DS) and set your TID and SID to any random number you want (I'll just
put both to 0) or if you already know them, put them to the values they
actually are. The TID and SID ONLY affect which advances will yield a
shiny later and have NO EFFECT on which Pokemon you encounter, what
stats they have or anything else.</p>
<p>Then change the Keypresses to not include 6, 7 and 8 Keypresses. This
isn't mandatory but pressing 6, 7 or 8 different buttons on your DS
during startup is sometimes not humanly possible and you should be able
to find target seeds without too many advances for almost anything you'd
want anyways without those high Keypress amounts. Unchecking those 3
Keypress options will also shorten search times later. You could also
remove more, like 4 and 5, but I find those still feasible and having
more Keypresses will make finding e.g. 5IV wild or static shiny targets
easier later (if you just care for getting shinies and don't care for
IVs or Natures at all, you can disable all but &quot;None&quot; Keypresses).</p>
<p>The <strong>Skip L/R</strong> checkbox is for if your console's L or R buttons are
broken, as if that box is checked off, PokéFinder will no longer give
any results with L or R as the required Keypresses.</p>
<p>Finally click on <strong>Accept</strong> and the profile is saved.</p>

<h2 id="setup-1">Setup</h2>
<p>This Method is <strong>exclusive to BW2</strong> and much faster than the other two
Methods. Similarly to the Save Needle Method, the Unova Link Needle
Calibration also makes use of the little clock symbol, but this time
when you're trying to establish an Infrared link between your current
BW2 game and another BW2 game using Unova Link. You don't need to
actually have another BW2 game for this, as simply starting the search
is all we need to do.</p>
<p>I will be using my English Black 2 game together with my Nintendo DS
console for this example.</p>
<p>To start the Unova Link Needle Calibration, you <strong>open up PokéFinder</strong>,
go to <strong>Gen 5 Tools</strong> at the top and open up the <strong>Profile Calibrator</strong>.</p>

<p>In the left half of the window, switch over to the <strong>Needle Search
tab</strong>, make sure the <strong>Unova Link option</strong> is selected and <strong>input the
date and time</strong> you wish to use for this. I'll just put it to the 23rd
of May 2025, 15:00 (aka 3pm) because that's the current date and time
whilst I'm writing this guide.</p>
<p>Then in the right half you start by selecting the <strong>game version</strong>,
<strong>language</strong>, <strong>console you play on</strong> and <strong>add your console's MAC
address</strong> which can be found in the internet settings of your console.
On DS and DS lite you need to access it from within the games menu and
on DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard wifi
settings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS). If
your MAC address starts with one or multiple 0's, those will
automatically be omitted by PokéFinder (e.g. a MAC address like
00-08-53-30-64-90 would become 853306490).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to find Mac address in DS or 3DS" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage37.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Also check the <strong>Memory Link checkbox</strong> if you have activated Memory
Link on this current savefile.</p>
<p>This can, of course, only be the case on pre-existing savefiles, so if
you just created a new one, you don't check the box. But if it is indeed
an older savefile you'll want to check whether Memory Link has been
activated or not by going to the Unova Link menu, then to the Memory
Link option and once there checking if the option „Memory List&quot; is
there. If it is, Memory Link is guaranteed active and you need to check
off the box for it, but if it isn't, that doesn't necessarily mean that
Memory Link was not used yet.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Memory link location BW2" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage33.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>I tested this myself and you can already do Memory Link with a Black or
White 1 game that hasn't even received the starter yet as long as the
game has any savefile present at all, even if it's got under a minute of
playtime. If Memory Link was used with such an early savefile there is
no way I know of to tell it was used on the BW2 games side, as the
Memory List option does not appear. So should you not find any valid
seeming results during calibration of an older BW2 savefile without the
Memory Link box checked off, try with it. My Black 2 has done Memory
Link so I will check off the box.</p>
<p><strong>Put the seconds</strong> Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -5 and
+5. So if you're <strong>on DS, Lite or i</strong> and used my recommended seconds,
put it <strong>to Min 15 and Max 25</strong> and <strong>on 3DS line models to Min 35 and
Max 45</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Needle Search set up for Unova Link" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage52.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>There's one more thing now that you will want to change if you're trying
to calibrate a BW2 game on a DSi or 3DS line model and that is the
Timer0 range. As of the time I'm writing this guide the default Timer0
range for BW2 games on DSi and 3DS models is 1600-1790, but this isn't
large enough of a range. Especially on non-english language games, such
as Japanese or German (can happen in other languages too though), I've
sometimes seen people have a Timer0 in the 1400s or 1800s. So we will
change the range to 1400-1900 to be able to find such calibration
results as well.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Timer0 range for 3DS and DSi" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage43.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Everything else you'll want to leave as it is by default (if you
accidentally change something else you can always just change game
version from BW1 to BW2 and then back or vice versa to reset to the
default values).</p>
<p>Note: (The Soft Reset checkbox.) The <strong>Soft Reset checkbox</strong> is
currently <strong>not working</strong> properly so don't use it.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt-1">First Attempt</h2>
<p>That finishes the PokéFinder setup; now you can start the first
calibration attempt.</p>
<p>For that you go to your console's settings and change the date to match
whichever date you put into the PokéFinder calibration window. Next you
go to the time settings and change the time according to the calibration
window as well, but <strong>at the same moment that you confirm the time
change, you start EonTimer</strong> by clicking the Start button.</p>
<div class="tabcontainer" num="2">
<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active"  onclick="openCity(event, 1, 2)" >DS</button>

</div>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Eontimer setup" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage35.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now you go back to the home menu (on DSi and 3DS line models you can
either navigate back through the settings or use the Power Button to get
back whilst on DS and Lite you have to shut off the console and turn it
back on after).</p>
<p>Once there you wait for the timer to run out and <strong>on the 6th and final
beep of EonTimer you start the game</strong>. Make sure <strong>not to press any
buttons in between you starting the game and the star appearing on the
top screen</strong>, since that will change the seed you're on and just add an
unnecessary extra step to this.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="The gamefreak logo starting up" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage15.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Once you see this star, you may start pressing buttons again. Navigate
to the <strong>UNOVA LINK</strong> menu, go to <strong>KEY SYSTEM</strong> and then select <strong>SEND
AND RECEIVE KEYS</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="How to get to the key system" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage50.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>With this being the Unova Link Needle Calibration method, we will make
use of the clock symbol that appears whenever you have the game try to
establish an infrared link to another BW2 game to send or receive keys;
the position the clock's hand starts at when activating the IR search is
what you need to pay attention to. How long you have the search active
for doesn't matter. You could cancel it immediately or have it go on for
a minute straight; makes no difference for the calibration.</p>
<p>Here's a GIF of the first needle I got during this calibration followed
by a picture of the starting position:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Gif of the key system save spinner" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage56.gif" width="60%"></center>
<br>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Image of my first save spinner" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage38.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>As you can see, the first needle starting position I got is a right
facing → needle, which I add into PokéFinder's calibration window by
clicking on the bottom left needle button.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="How to input your first arrow key" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage47.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>Now we continue on restarting the infrared connection via <strong>SEND AND
RECEIVE KEYS</strong> until we have the <strong>starting position of 8 needles in a
row</strong>. If you didn't see one of the needles starting positions, you
cannot continue and have to go back to the home menu to try again,
beginning with changing the time back and starting EonTimer.</p>
<p>Once you are done with the 8 needles, press the <strong>Search button</strong> and
see what result PokéFinder gives you.</p>
<p>In my case I got the following result:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My first timer0 result" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage10.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>There's a few things to watch out for here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your results Seconds value does not match your EonTimer's target
second, make sure it's not too far off. On DS, lite and i, the
second should never be off by more than 2. Being off by 1 is already
rare and being off by 2 near impossible but both have happened to
people in the past. On 3DS line models being off by 1 or 2 is fairly
common due to the console having an inconsistent bootup time for DS
games. Being off by 3 may also be possible in rare cases, but if you
get a result that's 4 or more seconds off, it's most likely an
invalid result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you get more than 1 result you can simply add a 9th needle
and press <strong>Search</strong> again and if that still isn't enough to narrow
it down to 1, add a 10th etc until you're at exactly 1 result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get no results at all or only get results that are too far
off from your target second, make sure all the values in your
PokéFinder and EonTimer are correct and match what's on your DS
console (date, time, MAC address, game version, language, DS type,
saving option selected and EonTimer calibration). Then just do
another attempt. Should you get 0 results again, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy
._.</em>'s RNG manip assistance Discord server</a>
and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation
of the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder
Calibration window and EonTimer</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The result I got here looks good though as it's the only one and the
second I hit is exactly the one I was aiming for in 20. Should you not
have hit your target second here though you will want to adjust your
EonTimer since in the future, when you get to actually RNGing e.g. a
Shiny Pokemon, you will need to hit the exact target second and not 1-2
seconds late or early.</p>
<p>To adjust EonTimer you simply take the second you hit instead of your
target,put it into the <strong>Second Hit field</strong> and press the <strong>Update
button</strong>. An example would be if I had hit 19 seconds instead of 20 I
would input 19 into the <strong>Second Hit field</strong> and press <strong>Update</strong> which
would change my EonTimer <strong>Calibration</strong> value from -95 to -66.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Updating Eontimer" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage6.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>I won't be changing this for my next attempt though, since I hit exactly
what I was aiming for.</p>
<p>After this first attempt we will now write down the values we got
somewhere (e.g. a standard text file):</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Start of my timer0 lists" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage1.png" width="40%"></center>
<h2 id="further-attempts-1">Further Attempts</h2>
<p>Now you'll want to do between <strong>19-29 more such calibrations for a total
of 20-30 attempts</strong> to <strong>find</strong> what <strong>your most common Timer0</strong> value
is on DS and DS Lite or <strong>29-39 for a total of 30-40</strong> more <strong>on DSi and
3DS</strong>. This is important because later when you're trying to RNG e.g. a
Shiny, you will want the highest chances of hitting your target Timer0.
If you were to only do 10 calibrations for example you may have just had
bad luck and like 7 times hit a Timer0 that, on average, you'd only get
about 10% of the time which also means you'd miss your target about 90%
of the time. Some date/time combinations may have one Timer0 be much
more common than it would be on most other date/time combinations. To
prevent this from giving you a Timer0, that on most other date/time
combinations you would barely ever hit, I recommend to <strong>change the
target time just a little bit after every calibration attempt</strong>. In my
example I'll just put the clock in both PokéFinder and on my DS console
forward by 1 minute each attempt so on attempt 2 I will target
15:01/3:01 pm, on attempt 3 15:02/3:02 pm and so on.</p>
<p>Another <strong>important thing to note</strong> is <strong>about the VCount</strong>. Whilst I
did say earlier that this value stays consistent throughout your
calibration, this isn't always true. If you're playing on a <strong>DSi or
3DS</strong> model console, you <strong>may get 2 different VCount values</strong> that are
tied to some of your Timer0's. This seemingly can only happen if the
VCount you get is either <strong>AC or AD</strong> (but getting one of the two
doesn't necessarily mean that you are affected by this; recently it was
discovered that a VCount of AB can also have this happen with AC though
it is much rarer than AD). In those cases you can also get the other
VCount of the two on some of your Timer0's. If this is the case for you,
make sure to note down which Timer0 has which VCount assigned to it.
This will generally not impact your ability to RNG Manipulate, but it
will make troubleshooting when something goes wrong a bit more annoying
later.</p>
<p>Example of how such a Timer0 distribution with 2 VCounts could look like
after 30 calibration attempts:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Big timer0 list" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage40.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>If even after adjusting EonTimer you still keep hitting 1-2 above or
below your target second most of the time, don't keep adjusting every
single attempt. Instead write down which second you hit every time, and
then at the end of the 5-10 attempts, take the average, round it up/down
and then use that average second hit to adjust your EonTimer. Especially
on 3DS models you will most likely continue to not always hit your
target second due to the varying loading times of those models.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-profile-1">Creating a Profile</h2>
<p>At the end of my 30 calibrations, my Timer0 distribution looked like
this:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Completed timer0 list for profile making" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage3.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>I hit 1104 9 times making it my most common Timer0. Now in the
PokéFinder calibration window we can right click into the last result we
got, making a small popup window appear, and there we select the
<strong>Create profile</strong> option.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to create a profile from" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage32.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>A smaller window will pop up with all the latest results' values and
your game version, language, console type and MAC address already filled
out. If your latest attempt did not result in your most common Timer0,
you may want to change both the Min Timer0 and the Max Timer0 to your
most common value; in my case I got 1105 last but knowing 1104 is more
common I will change it to that (if you did get 2 different VCounts make
sure to also change the VCount to the one that belongs with your most
common Timer0).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to input specific profile info" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage4.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you just input a name for the profile into the name field (I named
mine B2 DS CC because it's for my Pokemon Black 2 on my Capture Card DS)
and put your TID and SID to any random number you want (I'll just put
both to 0) or if you already know them, put them to the values they
actually are. The TID and SID ONLY affect which advances will yield a
shiny later and have NO EFFECT on which Pokemon you encounter, what
stats they have or anything else. Check off the Memory Link and Shiny
Charm checkboxes if you have done Memory Link or have received the Shiny
Charm (BW2 exclusive) and change the Keypresses to not include 6, 7 and
8 Keypresses. This isn't mandatory but pressing 6, 7 or 8 different
buttons on your DS during startup is sometimes not humanly possible and
you should be able to find target seeds without too many advances for
almost anything you'd want anyways without those high Keypress amounts.
Unchecking those 3 Keypress options will also shorten search times
later. You could also remove more, like 4 and 5, but I find those still
feasible and having more Keypresses will make finding e.g. 5IV wild or
static shiny targets easier later (if you just care for getting shinies
and don't care for IVs or Natures at all, you can disable all but &quot;None&quot;
Keypresses).</p>
<p>The <strong>Skip L/R</strong> checkbox is for if your console's L or R buttons are
broken, as if that box is checked off, PokéFinder will no longer spit
out any results with L or R as the required Keypresses.</p>
<p>Finally click on <strong>Accept</strong> and the profile is saved.</p>

<h2 id="iv-calibration">IV Calibration</h2>
<h2 id="setup-2">Setup</h2>
<p>This Method <strong>can be used in both BW1 and BW2 but is slower</strong> than the
other Methods, especially for BW2. Here you catch a Pokemon and then
calculate its IVs to find your calibration values. To make the IV
calculation easier, you should be saved in an area with as high as
possible level wild Pokemon. In BW1 I recommend the dark (not regular)
grass in the crater within Giant Chasm and in BW2 I recommend the dark
grass on Route 1.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Giant Chasm and bottom of Route 1 in BW2" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage54.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>You will also need either a Pokemon with the move <strong>Sweet Scent</strong> (e.g.
Foongus learns it at level 24) <strong>or</strong> at least 1 <strong>Honey item</strong> (can be
obtained via the Honey Gather ability from Combee which can be found in
the grass on Route 12 or you can buy it in BW2's Join Avenue Market
Shops that are level 2 or higher). Having an empty slot in your party,
several Rare Candies and a Master Ball will also make this process a lot
faster.</p>
<p>Note: (Are Rare Candies required?) If during IV Calibration you get 2 or
more different results, you will need to level up your Pokemon to get a
more precise IV range from the IV calculator. If you do this via
battling against other Pokemon and gaining EXP, your Pokemon will also
gain EVs which can increase stats and make the IV calculator's results
inaccurate. Using Rare Candies on the other hand does not give your
Pokemon any EVs making them very useful for IV calculation.</p>
<p>I will be using my English Black 2 game together with my capture card
Nintendo DS console for this example so I can take high quality pictures
of what's happening ingame.</p>
<p>To start the IV Calibration, you <strong>open up PokéFinder</strong>, go to <strong>Gen 5
Tools</strong> at the top and open up the <strong>Profile Calibrator</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where profile calibrator is" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage45.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the left half of the window, make sure the <strong>IV tab</strong> is selected and
<strong>input the date and time</strong> you wish to use for this. I'll just put it
to the 23rd of May 2025, 15:00 (aka 3pm) because that's the current date
and time whilst I'm writing this guide.</p>
<p>Then in the right half you start by selecting the <strong>game version</strong>,
<strong>language</strong>, <strong>console you play on</strong> and <strong>add your console's MAC
address</strong> which can be found in the internet settings of your console.
On DS and DS lite you need to access it from within the games menu and
on DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard wifi
settings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS). If
your MAC address starts with one or multiple 0's, those will
automatically be omitted by PokéFinder (e.g. a MAC address like
00-08-53-30-64-90 would become 853306490).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to find MAC Address on DS & 3DS" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage37.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Also check the <strong>Memory Link checkbox</strong> if you have activated Memory
Link on this current savefile (<strong>BW2 exclusive</strong> feature).</p>
<p>This can, of course, only be the case on pre-existing savefiles, so if
you just created a new one, you don't check off the box. But if it is
indeed an older savefile you'll want to check whether Memory Link has
been activated or not by going to the Unova Link menu, then to the
Memory Link option and once there checking if the option „Memory List&quot;
is there. If it is, Memory Link is guaranteed active and you need to
check off the box for it, but if it isn't, that doesn't necessarily mean
that Memory Link was not used yet.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where memory link is on BW2" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage33.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>I tested this myself and you can already do Memory Link with a Black or
White 1 game that hasn't even received the starter yet as long as the
game has any savefile present at all, even if it's got under a minute of
playtime. If Memory Link was used with such an early savefile there is
no way I know of to tell it was used on the BW2 games side, as the
Memory List option does not appear. So should you not find any valid
seeming results during calibration of an older BW2 savefile without the
Memory Link box checked off, try with it. My Black 2 has done Memory
Link so I will check off the box.</p>
<p><strong>Put the seconds</strong> Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -5 and
+5. So if you're <strong>on DS, Lite or i</strong> and used my recommended seconds,
put it <strong>to Min 15 and Max 25</strong> and <strong>on 3DS line models to Min 35 and
Max 45</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="IV Search tab in Profile Calibrator" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage20.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>There's one more thing now that you will want to change if you're trying
to calibrate a BW2 game on a DSi or 3DS line model and that is the
Timer0 range. As of the time I'm writing this guide the default Timer0
range for BW2 games on DSi and 3DS models is 1600-1790, but this isn't
large enough of a range. Especially on non-english language games, such
as Japanese or German (can happen in other languages too though), I've
sometimes seen people have a Timer0 in the 1400s or 1800s. So we will
change the range to 1400-1900 to be able to find such calibration
results as well.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Timer0 settings for BW2 on DSi and 3DS" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage2.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>Everything else you'll want to leave as it is by default (if you
accidentally change something else you can always just change game
version from BW1 to BW2 and then back or vice versa to reset to the

unnecessary extra step to this.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Star of gamefreak logo, when it's okay to press A" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage15.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Once you see this star, you may start pressing buttons and get into the
game. If you're far enough into the story to have received the
<strong>C-Gear</strong>, you <strong>must deactivate</strong> it upon entering the game as it
would otherwise advance the RNG and make calibration impossible.</p>
<p>Ingame you will want to go into your <strong>party menu/bag</strong> and <strong>use Sweet
Scent as a field move/honey to summon a wild Pokemon</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Using Sweet Scent from Party Menu" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage28.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>It doesn't matter how quickly or slowly you do this, just make sure to
not move your player character as that can advance the IVrng and thus
screw up this calibration attempt. If you are doing this in the dark
grass as I recommended, you may end up getting a double battle against 2
wild Pokemon. In that case you will need to kill the Pokemon on the left
and catch the Pokemon on the right side of the field (preferably using a
Master Ball so you don't have to waste time with failed catches).</p>
<p>With the first caught Pokemon in our party, we open up the IV calculator
in PokéFinder.</p>

characteristic &amp; nature</strong> <strong>and</strong> at the bottom <strong>it's level and
stats</strong>.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: some of the characteristics have been renamed in newer generations. PokeFinder uses the updated names. The two characteristics affected are: &quot;Often dozes off&quot; which is now called &quot;Takes plenty of siestas&quot; and &quot;Often scatters things&quot; which is now called &quot;Nods off a lot.&quot;</p>

<details>
<summary>Note: Characteristics and Natures in other languages.</summary>
If you're playing in a different language than english, you can change the
language of PokéFinder in its settings, which will also change the
characteristic and nature names to the ones of that language.

<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Watchogs stats in IV Calculator" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage22.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Once all the data is in the fields, you can press the <strong>Find IVs
button</strong> and it'll spit out the calculated IVs in the bottom right.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Shown stats of watchog" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage7.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Should any of the results say <strong>Invalid</strong> instead of a number or number
range, you input something wrongly. Double check all data is correct and
without typos.</p>
<p>Pressing <strong>Find IVs will</strong> also <strong>automatically send the results over to
the calibration window</strong> which means all we have to do now is press the
<strong>Search button</strong> and see what result PokéFinder gives us.</p>
<p>In my case I got the following result:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="First timer0 result" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage12.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>There's a few things to watch out for here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your results Seconds value does not match your EonTimer's target
second, make sure it's not too far off. On DS, lite and i, the
second should never be off by more than 2. Being off by 1 is already
rare and being off by 2 near impossible but both have happened to
people in the past. On 3DS line models being off by 1 or 2 is fairly
common due to the console having an inconsistent bootup time for DS
games. Being off by 3 may also be possible in rare cases, but if you
get a result that's 4 or more seconds off, it's most likely an
invalid result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you get more than 1 result, you can level up the Pokemon
using a rare candy, press the Add row button in the IV calculator,
input all the next levels stats and press Find IVs again. Then in
the calibration window you press <strong>Search</strong> again and if that still
isn't enough to narrow it down to 1, add another level etc until
you're at exactly 1 result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get no results at all or only get results that are too far
off from your target second, make sure all the values in your
PokéFinder and EonTimer are correct and match what's on your DS
console (date, time, MAC address, game version, language, DS type,
saving option selected and EonTimer calibration). Then just do
another attempt. Should you get 0 results again, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy
._.</em>'s RNG manip assistance Discord server</a>
and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation
of the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder
Calibration window and EonTimer</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The result I got here looks good though as it's the only one and the
second I hit is exactly the one I was aiming for in 20. Should you not
have hit your target second here though you will want to adjust your
EonTimer since in the future, when you get to actually RNGing e.g. a
Shiny Pokemon, you will need to hit the exact target second and not 1-2
seconds late or early.</p>
<p>To adjust EonTimer you simply take the second you hit instead of your
target,put it into the <strong>Second Hit field</strong> and press the <strong>Update
button</strong>. An example would be if I had hit 19 seconds instead of 20 I
would input 19 into the <strong>Second Hit field</strong> and press <strong>Update</strong> which
would change my EonTimer <strong>Calibration</strong> value from -95 to -66.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Updating Eontimer" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage6.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>I won't be changing this for my next attempt though, since I hit exactly
what I was aiming for.</p>
<p>After this first attempt we will now write down the values we got
somewhere (e.g. a standard text file):</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Start of my timer0 list" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage24.png" width="40%"></center>
<h2 id="further-attempts-2">Further Attempts</h2>
<p>Now if you're calibrating a <strong>BW1</strong> game, you'll want to do between
<strong>4-9 more such calibrations for a total of 5-10 attempts</strong> to <strong>find</strong>
what <strong>your most common Timer0</strong> value is. For <strong>BW2</strong> you should do
<strong>19-29 more such calibrations for a total of 20-30 attempts</strong> to find
what your most common Timer0 value is <strong>on DS and DS Lite</strong> or <strong>29-39
for a total of 30-40 more on DSi and 3DS</strong>. This is important because
later when you're trying to RNG e.g. a Shiny, you will want the highest
chances of hitting your target Timer0. If you were to only do 10
calibrations for example you may have just had bad luck and like 7 times
hit a Timer0 that, on average, you'd only get about 10% of the time
which also means you'd miss your target about 90% of the time. Some
date/time combinations may have one Timer0 be much more common than it
would be on most other date/time combinations. To prevent this from
giving you a Timer0, that on most other date/time combinations you would
barely ever hit, I recommend to <strong>change the target time just a little
bit after every calibration attempt</strong>. In my example I'll just put the
clock in both PokéFinder and on my DS console forward by 1 minute each
attempt so on attempt 2 I will target 15:01/3:01 pm, on attempt 3
15:02/3:02 pm and so on.</p>
<p>Another <strong>important thing to note</strong> is <strong>about the VCount</strong>. Whilst I
did say earlier that this value stays consistent throughout your
calibration, this isn't always true. If you're playing on a <strong>DSi or
3DS</strong> model console, you <strong>may get 2 different VCount values</strong> that are
tied to some of your Timer0's. This seemingly can only happen if the
VCount you get is either <strong>AC or AD</strong> (but getting one of the two
doesn't necessarily mean that you are affected by this; recently it was
discovered that a VCount of AB can also have this happen with AC though
it is much rarer than AD). In those cases you can also get the other
VCount of the two on some of your Timer0's. If this is the case for you,
make sure to note down which Timer0 has which VCount assigned to it.
This will generally not impact your ability to RNG Manipulate, but it
will make troubleshooting when something goes wrong a bit more annoying
later.</p>
<p>Example of how such a Timer0 distribution with 2 VCounts could look like
after 30 calibration attempts:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Timer0 distrobution via the list" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage40.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>If even after adjusting EonTimer you still keep hitting 1-2 above or
below your target second most of the time, don't keep adjusting every
single attempt. Instead write down which second you hit every time, and
then at the end of the 5-40 attempts, take the average, round it up/down
and then use that average second hit to adjust your EonTimer. Especially
on 3DS models you will most likely continue to not always hit your
target second due to the varying loading times of those models.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-profile-2">Creating a Profile</h2>
<p>At the end of my 30 calibrations, my Timer0 distribution looked like
this:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Full timer0 list" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage3.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>I hit 1104 9 times making it my most common Timer0. Now in the
PokéFinder calibration window we can right click into the last result we
got, making a small popup window appear, and there we select the
<strong>Create profile</strong> option.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Creating a profile" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage51.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>A smaller window will pop up with all the latest results' values and
your game version, language, console type and MAC address already filled
out. If your latest attempt did not result in your most common Timer0,
you may want to change both the Min Timer0 and the Max Timer0 to your
most common value; in my case I got 1105 last but knowing 1104 is more
common I will change it to that (if you did get 2 different VCounts make
sure to also change the VCount to the one that belongs with your most
common Timer0).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Profile editor window" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage4.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you just input a name for the profile into the name field (I named
mine B2 DS CC because it's for my Pokemon Black 2 on my Capture Card DS)
and put your TID and SID to any random number you want (I'll just put
both to 0) or if you already know them, put them to the values they
actually are. The TID and SID ONLY affect which advances will yield a
shiny later and have NO EFFECT on which Pokemon you encounter, what
stats they have or anything else. Check off the Memory Link and Shiny
Charm checkboxes if you have done Memory Link or have received the Shiny
Charm (BW2 exclusive) and change the Keypresses to not include 6, 7 and
8 Keypresses. This isn't mandatory but pressing 6, 7 or 8 different
buttons on your DS during startup is sometimes not humanly possible and
you should be able to find target seeds without too many advances for
almost anything you'd want anyways without those high Keypress amounts.
Unchecking those 3 Keypress options will also shorten search times
later. You could also remove more, like 4 and 5, but I find those still
feasible and having more Keypresses will make finding e.g. 5IV wild or
static shiny targets easier later (if you just care for getting shinies
and don't care for IVs or Natures at all, you can disable all but &quot;None&quot;
Keypresses).</p>
<p>The <strong>Skip L/R checkbox</strong> is for if your console's L or R buttons are
broken, as if that box is checked off, PokéFinder will no longer spit
out any results with L or R as the required Keypresses.</p>
<p>Finally click on <strong>Accept</strong> and the profile is saved.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Finalizing a profile" src="/bw/beginner/calibrationimage23.png" width="100%"></center> </div>
</div>
<h2 id="next-steps"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Anchor link for: next-steps">Next Steps...</a></h2>
<p>Now you're ready to start RNG Manipulation in Generation 5! If you are
willing to delete your game's current savefile, go to the TID/SID RNG
Guide next, as in Gen 5 you can only find your SID by either RNG
Manipulating for a TID/SID pair at the start of a savefile or by
hacking.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can of course RNG Manipulate for e.g. perfect IV wild
or static encounters that are not shiny without your SID just fine too,
in which case you can go to Wild or Static RNG Guides next.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and have fun RNGing!</p>
