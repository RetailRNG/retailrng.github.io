<p><strong>To be able to RNG manipulate for Shinies, you need to know both your
Trainer ID (TID) and Secret ID (SID)</strong>. The TID you can simply view on
the back of your Trainer Card, but the SID is hidden away and not
visible to the player in any way.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Trainer Card in Gen 5" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage8.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Unlike prior games from Generations 3 and 4, in Gen 5 <strong>you can no
longer find out your Secret ID from a randomly encountered shiny</strong> or
really via any other method in the game. This means that the only ways
of figuring out your SID are to either hack to view your SID using
programs such as PKHeX, or to reset your game and RNG manipulate a
TID/SID pair at the start of the new game, which is what this guide will
teach you.<br />
Should you already have an older savefile on your game that you are not
willing to delete, do not have access to hacks and still wish to RNG
manipulate for shinies in Gen 5, you can use the program <a href="https://github.com/kuroppoi/entralinked/wiki/Setup">Entralinked by
Kuroppoi</a>.
Follow the Setup Guide, tuck in a Pokemon you caught on your savefile
and you'll be able to view its SID in the user interface of the program.</p>
<p>In the past in Generations 3 and 4 there was something called „PID/IV
correlation&quot;, which meant that you could not just get any IV+nature
spread shiny on any random TID/SID, but you only had at most 1 or 2
spreads with 5 or 6 perfect IVs that you could get as shinies on
Stationary, Gift or Wild encounters, if any such good ones at all. There
you had to RNG manip a TID/SID at the start of your adventure if you
wanted e.g. a 6IV shiny Dialga. <strong>In Gen 5</strong> this is no longer the case
and <strong>every single TID/SID combination can get every possible IV+nature
spread as a shiny</strong>.</p>
<p>There's <strong>3 cases in which you should still RNG manip a specific TID/SID
pair</strong> though to save yourself from wasting a lot of time <strong>and that is
for the Starter or Roamer in BW1 and for the Starter in BW2</strong>. This is
<strong>only relevant if you want any of those 3 to have 5 or 6 perfect IVs
AND be shiny</strong>. <strong>If you just care for the IVs or just care for
Shininess</strong> for the three mentioned cases, but not both combined,
<strong>there's no point in preparing for it now</strong> and instead you will want
to do TID/SID RNG just to get a specific ID number like e.g. your
favorite number. Most older guides just had you execute the RNG without
going for anything specific and then just take the first TID/SID pair
that PokeFinder tells you you supposedly hit, but that often lead to
people being unable to get shinies later as the TID/SID presented by the
program were not what they actually hit. So going for a specific number
ensures that once you do get it, you can be confident it's the correct
one.</p>

enough smaller differences that warrant having them be in 2 separate

<p>As alluded to earlier, in the cases of the Starter and Roamer in BW1,
you may want to prepare for those now. If you simply want a shiny
(possibly with a specific nature) of either of the two or just want them
to have perfect IVs and a beneficial nature but without being shiny,
there's no use in preparing for that now as it'll be fairly easy to get
later on anyways. If you however do want 5/6 perfect IVs AND for it to
be shiny, you should prepare for that to save yourself many hours of
time later. </p>
<p>This is important for the Starter, as that early on in the
game you lack Chatot which are the primary tool used to advance the RNG
forward relatively quickly and consistently, and instead you only have
the very slow saving the game as a way to advance. So to not have to
save the game 500 times wasting 2 hours of your time, you should prepare
a target seed that has 5/6 perfect IVs on IV Advance 0 with an early PID
Advance that has the nature you desire which you can then turn shiny.</p>
<details>
<Summary>Note: Difference between PIDrng Advances and IV Advances.</summary>
Generation 5 uses 2 completely separate RNG algorithms to decide all the random
things that happen in the game. The two being separate also means that
whilst one of the two can move by hundreds or even thousands of
Advances, the other can remain at the exact same Advance throughout it
all.
<p><br />
The first of the two, commonly referred to as the <strong>PIDrng</strong>, controls
the <strong>&quot;regular&quot; Advances</strong>. These Advances decide an encountered
Pokemons encounter slot (so which species of the on a Route available
ones you'll get), its nature, ability, gender, PID (which decides
whether it's shiny or not) and whether it's holding an item or not. This
PIDrng algorithm is used by many things in the game to determine their
random patterns which also means they all advance this algorithm forward
whenever they perform a randomized action. Notably this includes the
movement of randomly moving NPCs, Rain/Snow/Hail/Sandstorm patterns, the
game deciding whether you should trigger a wild encounter when walking
through Tall Grass and how high of a pitch a custom recorded Chatter
should have each time you view the summary of a Chatot (among many other
more minor things).</p>
<p><br />
The second RNG algorithm, commonly referred to as the <strong>IVrng</strong>, is used
for far fewer things however. It mainly controls what IVs (and with that
Hidden Power since it's fully dependent on IVs) a Pokemon you encounter
will have. It also controls the friendship step counter which activates
every 128 steps and has a 50/50 chance to increase each party members
friendship by 1, whether a Pokemon gets Pokerus after a battle and ALL
the randomized actions inside a battle such as whether a Focus Blast
hits or misses or whether a flamethrower gets a burn on the opposing
Pokemon. Due to it controlling all random actions in battles, it was
made to advance at 60 Advances per second for each Pokemon active on the
field to make it harder to manipulate the luck in battles. Before you
enter any battle, if you make sure not to move your player character,
the IVrng will always start on IV Advance 0 and not move past that until
after your encounter is generated so for almost ALL RNGs in Generation
5, you'll want to look for a target with the desired IVs on IV Advance
0.</p>
<p><br />
The C-Gear is a bit of an odd case here as it doesn't really need
anything randomized to happen but it still Advances both the PIDrng AND
the IVrng whenever it's active (technically in BW1 specifically it
doesn't even advance the IVrng but completely changes the whole IVrng
algorithm but thats besides the point).</p>
</details>
<p><strong>How to actually RNG manipulate the Starter later I will not explain
here</strong> but in a specific Starter RNG guide. As for the Roamer you'll
also want to prepare for a 5/6 IV shiny now, as it's the single most
annoyingly inconsistent RNG in all of Gen 5 due to both the random
interference from NPCs on Route 7 and the storm cutscene itself
advancing the RNG by wildly varying amounts. Going for less than 5/6
perfect IVs will also actually make this more difficult for reasons I
will not explain here; so you must choose between getting a 5/6 IV and
getting one with fully random IVs. Due to the scope of the preparations
needed <strong>for the Roamer, I will not explain how to prepare for it at all
in this guide but rather make it a section of the Roamer RNG guide you
can find <a href="/bw/extra%20credit/roamer/">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You can only prepare for one of the two, the Starter or the Roamer</strong>,
on your savefile, so choose wisely. To find out how to prepare for
getting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter, check out the following note.</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: Getting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter.</summary> 
<p>To get a seed to target for your Starter, you'll want to start by <strong>opening up Pokefinder</strong>, going to the
<strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there opening the <strong>Static option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="PokeFinder Gen 5 Tab" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage17.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the <strong>profile</strong> of the
game you wish to do this in <strong>is selected</strong> and right below the profile
option <strong>switch to the searcher tab</strong> in which there's 3 different
sections labeled &quot;<strong>RNG Info</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Settings</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Filters</strong>&quot;.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Setting up searcher for a 5 IV Shiny" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage38.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In the <strong>RNG Info section</strong>, put the <strong>Max Advances to 10</strong> and <strong>input
a date range you wish to search through</strong> (I personally would pick the
full current month) whilst <strong>leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV
Advances, Initial Advances and Lucky Power all at 0</strong>. Next in the
<strong>Settings section</strong>, <strong>select the</strong> <strong>Starters Category</strong> with the
Starter you wish to RNG and finally in the <strong>Filters section</strong> <strong>input
your desired IVs, Gender and Nature</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My settings for a 5 IV Shiny" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage15.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you can hit the <strong>Search button</strong> and if you get no results you can
either search through a different date range (e.g. the full next month),
increase the Max Advances (don't forget saving the game to advance is
your only option and takes quite a while) or select more possible
Keypresses in your profile. Once you've found a result you're happy
with, <strong>copy its PID and write it down</strong> somewhere you can find it again
later.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Chosen result PID" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage23.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>If I were to prepare for a Starter, I would take this marked one as the
Keypresses are easy and the target second in 21 is very quick (would be
quite long if you're on a 3DS model but I'm not). Now <strong>best to also
e.g. take a screenshot of the full window</strong> to easily be able to find
this target seed again in the future when you get to actually RNG the
starter itself. That's all the prep you need, so you can now continue on
with the guide.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Open up PokeFinder</strong>, go to the <strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there open the
<strong>IDs option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="How to get to IDs tab in PokeFinder" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage21.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>There <strong>select the profile</strong> of the game you wish to do TID/SID RNG in
if it isn't selected already and in the left half of the window labeled
<strong>Search By</strong>, <strong>put the start and end date to however long of a time
window you wish to search through</strong> (I'll search through one week
starting on the 11th of August 2025 and ending on the 17th) and set the
<strong>Max Advances to 0</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Profile & date selection" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage9.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now there's 3 more checkboxes with fields next to them labeled <strong>PID</strong>,
<strong>TID</strong> and <strong>SID</strong>. The <strong>SID field you basically never want to use</strong>
unless you have a HIGHLY specific purpose for it (mainly would be used
to nickname event Pokemon as that requires matching TID, SID, trainer
name, trainer gender and game of origin). The <strong>PID field is for when
you wish to prepare your savefile to easily</strong> be able to <strong>get</strong> e.g.
<strong>a 5/6 IV Starter or Roamer</strong> and the <strong>TID field</strong> <strong>is for</strong> <strong>when
you wish to get a specific number Trainer ID</strong>. Neither of those two are
required but I recommend aiming for a TID number you like as it does not
affect the difficulty of the RNG at all. In this example I will check
off both boxes and input the PID of a 5IV Timid Roamer I prepared for
and the TID number of 00555 just because I think it's a funny number.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="PID & TID Selection" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage30.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>If you wish to get a number that starts with any 0's such as my 00555,
be aware that PokeFinder will only let you input the 555 as it has the
exact same value as 00555; once you successfully RNG it to be your
savefiles TID, it'll show up as 00555 as expected (05050 for example is
input as 5050; only 0's at the front of a number, before any not-0
number, can be ignored). The <strong>Static/Wild checkbox</strong> is required to
check off if you were to prepare for a Stationary or Wild encounters PID
to turn shiny, but you're probably preparing for either nothing, the
Starter (Gift encounter) or for the Roamer, <strong>so no need to check off
that box</strong>. <strong>Then you can click Search</strong> and if you searched for
nothing specific at all or only searched for either a specific TID
number or a specific PID to be turned shiny, but not both, you will most
definitely get several results already.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Results of search" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage41.png" width="90%"></center>
<p>Since I was looking for both a specific TID and a PID, I did not get any
results this time and now have 3 options:</p>
<p>1. Increase the date range I search through. Since I want the
&quot;Adventure Started&quot; date to be close to the actual date, I personally am
not willing to increase this.<br />
2. Increase Max Advances. Whilst Advances will make each attempt take a
bit longer, even just 5 of them will have PokeFinder search through
significantly more results so I'll put them to 5. I'd say doing up to 20
is generally within reason. I will explain how to actually do Advances
later.</p>
<p>3. Increase Keypresses in my profile. I'm already at 0-4 and whilst 5
is still usually doable, having increased the Advances to 4 should be
enough for my specific case.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Results with increased settings" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage10.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now searching again with the settings adjusted, PokeFinder found 6
target seeds I can go for. Since I'm lazy I'll go with the one that
requires less work from me. The fifth one has by far the most
comfortable target seconds for me to aim for in 24; the others are
either so low that I'd have to add a full minute to the timer or are
~30 seconds higher anyways. On 3DS the threshold for what target
seconds will have you add a minute to the timer is gonna be much lower
so going for something between like 40-55 target seconds would be most
comfortable there. The seed has Advances of 34 and Initial Advances of
30 which means that I'd later have to do 34-30=4 manual Advances myself.
There's also 2 Keypresses in the Start and Up buttons that I'll have to
press during startup of the game later.</p>
<h2 id="the-rng-process">The RNG Process</h2>
<p>Open up <strong>EonTimer</strong> and there <strong>put the Target Second to your seeds
seconds</strong> (24 in my case), <strong>go into the DS menu to change the date to
the target date</strong> (here the 12th of August 2025) <strong>and get ready to
change and confirm the target time</strong> (16:07 for me; should EonTimer say
&quot;<strong>Minutes Before Target: 1</strong>&quot; and your target time is e.g. 12:30:05,
you'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>At the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,
press the Start button in EonTimer</strong>. Now go back to the home menu, get
ready to <strong>start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer
sounds</strong> and make sure to <strong>press and hold any buttons your target seed
may require</strong> (start pressing the buttons right after you started the
game and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will
need to press and hold the Start button and the Up direction on the
D-pad).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="When it's okay to press A" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage27.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now continue on selecting the &quot;<strong>NEW GAME</strong>&quot; option, <strong>go through the
introduction sequence</strong>, choose your gender and name yourself. After
confirming your name on the bottom screen by clicking on OK, <strong>Professor
Juniper will ask you whether she got your name right and this is the
moment you can Advance the RNG</strong> if your target ID pair requires any
Advances.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to say no to advance the rng" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage7.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In my case I will need to do 4 Advances, so I say &quot;No&quot; to her question a
total of 4 times. <strong>Each time you say &quot;No&quot; when Juniper asks you this,
the RNG Advances by 1</strong> so do this however often is required for your
target ID pair. After you're done with advancing you can finish up the
introduction and get through the conversation with Cheren and Bianca.
Right after, <strong>as soon as you can move your character</strong>, open up the
menu by pressing X, go to the trainer info option (will just be named
whatever you named yourself; has a yellow card symbol), click on the
trainer card symbol in the bottom left and flip the card on its back
using the flip <img src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage12.png" > button to <strong>see what TID you got</strong>. <strong>If
you got your target TID number</strong> congratulations, <strong>you</strong> just
successfully RNG manipulated your TID/SID and <strong>can now skip to the
&quot;Next Steps...&quot; section</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>If it is not your target TID number however, you first gotta find out
what else you may have hit</strong> to make sure nothing else went wrong. Start
by <strong>opening the</strong> Profile Manager at the top. Here <strong>create a new
profile that is an exact copy of the profile of the game that you have
been using</strong> for this IDrng as of yet, <strong>but with one difference</strong>: for
the <strong>Min and Max Timer0,</strong> <strong>input both Timer0 values that you can get
here</strong>. I for example can get both C78 and C79 as my Timer0's, so I'll
put the Min to the lower value of the two in C78 and the Max to the
higher value in C79. If you don't know your other, less common Timer0
value, just put the range to include both the Timer0 above and the
Timer0 below your main one (in my case that would be C78 below and C7A
above my main C79) as that'll make the program search all three
Timer0's. I'll name this new profile &quot;B1 Phat Troubleshooting&quot; since
it's for troubleshooting my Black 1 game that I RNG with on my DS.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Profile Calibrator Troubleshooting setup" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage1.png" width="90%"></center>
<p><strong>This profile will ONLY be for troubleshooting.</strong> <strong>Whenever you search
for a target seed, you should always select your main profile</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Save the profile</strong>, go <strong>back to the IDs window</strong>, <strong>select this newly
created profile</strong> and now <strong>input the TID you got into the right half of
PokeFinders IDrng</strong> <strong>section</strong> labeled &quot;<strong>Seed Finder</strong>&quot;, put the
<strong>date</strong>, <strong>hour</strong> and <strong>minute</strong> to that <strong>of your target seed</strong>, the
<strong>Second Range to be +/-1 of your target second</strong> if you're <strong>on
DS/Lite/i</strong> and <strong>+/-3 if you're on 3DS</strong> models (so 23-25 for me since
my target is 24 and I'm on a DS) and <strong>put the Max Advances to the
amount you need to do +1</strong> (so 4+1=5 in my case). Now <strong>press the Find
button</strong> and you should be presented with at least 1 result.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Finding what timer0 I hit" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage36.png" width="90%"></center>
<p>If there's nothing that likely means you did something wrong. Double
check all the date and time settings match in both PokeFinder and on
your DS. After you checked simply try again whether you noticed
something or not and if you still get nothing, calibrate your profile
one more attempt to make sure you didn't accidentally write down the
wrong VCount or something. If after all that you still cannot seem to
get anything, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy ._.</em>'s RNG manip assistance Discord
server</a> and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation of
the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder IDs window and
EonTimer</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do get a result, you now need to check whether it's sensible by
having a look at the Advances. Optimally whatever you hit should have
the exact same Keypresses your target ID has and the difference between
the Advances and the Initial Advances columns should match the amount of
manual Advances you did, but since we're all only human and can e.g.
miscount, if it's 1 Advance too much or 1 too little it's likely still
valid. Also have a look at the second you hit vs the second you
targeted. Normally on DS, Lite and i you should always hit your exact
target second whilst on 3DS models hitting 1 off is fairly common. If
the result is off any more than that, do 1 more <a href="/bw/beginner/calibration">Profile Calibration</a> and adjust your EonTimer with the second
you hit instead of your target if needed.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My TID" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage31.png" width="60%"></center>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Results in PokeFinder" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage24.png" width="90%"></center>
<p>In my first attempt I hit a TID of 16293 which I get 2 results for. I
know the second one is the one I hit because the Keypresses match and
36-32=4 which matches the amount of Advances I did precisely as well.
The second I hit is also 24 just like my target but the Timer0 I hit is
my rarer Timer0 in C78 instead of my target C79. That'll just happen
sometimes; nothing I can do about that except try again and hope I won't
get Timer0'd again. </p>
<p><strong>Whilst in theory this is a valid hit</strong> <strong>and</strong> if
I didn't care for my TID to be 00555 specifically (and didn't want a
5/6IV shiny Starter or Roamer) <strong>I could just proceed now being done
with TID/SID RNG, I would advise against it</strong>. The amount of times I've
seen people who thought they got an ID pair just because PokeFinder
displayed it to them when in reality something went wrong making them
unable to get e.g. a shiny Starter later is in the dozens. </p>
<p><strong>I ALWAYS
recommend people to continue until they get the specific TID/SID pair
they originally aimed for</strong>. That is the only way to ensure you did
indeed get what PokeFinder tells you you got and with IDrng being one of
the easiest RNGs in Gen 5 it's not gonna take particularly long or be
very difficult to successfully do either. So now you just <strong>rinse and
repeat this RNG until you get your desired ID pair</strong>.</p>

left to do is go to the Profile Manager at the top left of the IDs

<p>As alluded to earlier, in the case of the Starter in BW2, you may want
to prepare for it now. If you simply want a shiny (possibly with a
specific nature and gender) or just want it to have perfect IVs and a
beneficial nature but without being shiny, there's no use in preparing
for that now as it'll be fairly easy to get later on anyways. If you
however do want 5/6 perfect IVs AND for it to be shiny, you should
prepare for that to save yourself many hours of time later.</p>
<p>This is
important for the Starter, as that early on in the game you lack Chatot
which are the primary tool used to advance the RNG forward relatively
quickly and consistently, and instead you only have the very slow saving
the game as a way to advance. But even that is highly unreliable for the
Starter as there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in when you're standing
in front of Bianca which can and will advance the RNG by inconsistent
amounts between saves. Here you should prepare a target seed that has
5/6 perfect IVs on IV Advance 0 with an early PIDrng Advance that has
the nature you desire which you can then turn shiny.</p>
<details>
<Summary>Note: Difference between PIDrng Advances and IV Advances.</summary>
Generation 5 uses 2 completely separate RNG algorithms to decide all the random
things that happen in the game. The two being separate also means that
whilst one of the two can move by hundreds or even thousands of
Advances, the other can remain at the exact same Advance throughout it
all.
<p><br />
The first of the two, commonly referred to as the <strong>PIDrng</strong>, controls
the <strong>&quot;regular&quot; Advances</strong>. These Advances decide an encountered
Pokemons encounter slot (so which species of the on a Route available
ones you'll get), its nature, ability, gender, PID (which decides
whether it's shiny or not) and whether it's holding an item or not. This
PIDrng algorithm is used by many things in the game to determine their
random patterns which also means they all advance this algorithm forward
whenever they perform a randomized action. Notably this includes the
movement of randomly moving NPCs, Rain/Snow/Hail/Sandstorm patterns, the
game deciding whether you should trigger a wild encounter when walking
through Tall Grass and how high of a pitch a custom recorded Chatter
should have each time you view the summary of a Chatot (among many other
more minor things).</p>
<p><br />
The second RNG algorithm, commonly referred to as the <strong>IVrng</strong>, is used
for far fewer things however. It mainly controls what IVs (and with that
Hidden Power since it's fully dependent on IVs) a Pokemon you encounter
will have. It also controls the friendship step counter which activates
every 128 steps and has a 50/50 chance to increase each party members
friendship by 1, whether a Pokemon gets Pokerus after a battle and ALL
the randomized actions inside a battle such as whether a Focus Blast
hits or misses or whether a flamethrower gets a burn on the opposing
Pokemon. Due to it controlling all random actions in battles, it was
made to advance at 60 Advances per second for each Pokemon active on the
field to make it harder to manipulate the luck in battles. Before you
enter any battle, if you make sure not to move your player character,
the IVrng will always start on IV Advance 0 and not move past that until
after your encounter is generated so for almost ALL RNGs in Generation
5, you'll want to look for a target with the desired IVs on IV Advance
0.</p>
<p><br />
The C-Gear is a bit of an odd case here as it doesn't really need
anything randomized to happen but it still Advances both the PIDrng AND
the IVrng whenever it's active (technically in BW1 specifically it
doesn't even advance the IVrng but completely changes the whole IVrng
algorithm but thats besides the point).</p>

<p><strong>How to actually RNG manipulate the Starter later I will not explain
here</strong> but in a specific Starter RNG guide. To find out how to prepare
for a 5/6 IV shiny Starter, check out the following note.</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: Getting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter.</summary> 
<p><br />
To get a seed to target for your
Starter, you'll want to start by <strong>opening up Pokefinder</strong>, going to the
<strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there opening the <strong>Static option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Static button gen 5 main window Pokefinder" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage17.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the <strong>profile</strong> of the
game you wish to do this in <strong>is selected</strong> and right below the profile
option <strong>switch to the searcher tab</strong> in which there's 3 different
sections labeled &quot;<strong>RNG Info</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Settings</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Filters</strong>&quot;.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Setting up gen 5 statics profile" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage37.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In the <strong>RNG Info section</strong>, put the <strong>Initial Advances to 3,</strong> the
<strong>Max Advances</strong> to 2 and <strong>input a date range you wish to search
through</strong> (I personally would pick the full current month) whilst
<strong>leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV Advances and Lucky Power all
at 0</strong> (the Initial and Max Advances being set to 3 and 2 means the
program will start searching at Advance 3 and until Advance 5 since
3+2=5. </p>
<p>We want this due to the 2 randomly moving NPCs that interfere
with taking the starter being here, as on average, they do between 3-5
Advances in between you loading into the game and taking the Starter if
you're as fast as you can be; 4 is the by far most common amount however
3 or 5 is still common enough and will give us more results in the
searcher hence why 3-5 is the Advance range I recommend). Next in the
<strong>Settings section</strong>, <strong>select the</strong> <strong>Starters Category</strong> with the
Starter you wish to RNG and finally in the <strong>Filters section</strong> <strong>input
your desired IVs, Gender and Nature</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Search settings for 5/6IV Starter" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage14.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now you can hit the <strong>Search button</strong> and if you get no results you can
either search through a different date range (e.g. the full next month)
or select more possible Keypresses in your profile. I do not recommend
changing the Advance range at all for BW2 as that'll mean you'll have to
rely on the inconsistent Advances of the NPCs to get you to your target
Advance. Once you've found a result you're happy with, <strong>copy its PID
and write it down somewhere</strong> you can find it again later.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Selected PID" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage40.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>I will use this 6 IV Adamant Female Snivy seed (for which I needed to
increase my Keypresses up to 5 at a time to find it). The target second
is not too bad and Keypresses are fine enough; there's far worse
combinations of 5 Keypresses to hold on a DS Phat model. Now <strong>best to
also e.g. take a screenshot of the full window</strong> to easily be able to
find this target seed again in the future when you get to actually RNG
the starter itself. That's all the prep you need, so you can now
continue on with the guide.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Open up PokeFinder</strong>, go to the <strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there open the
<strong>IDs option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="TID/SID Window PokeFinder" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage21.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>There <strong>select the profile</strong> of the game you wish to do TID/SID RNG in
if it isn't selected already and in the left half of the window labeled
<strong>Search By</strong>, <strong>put the start and end date to however long of a time
window you wish to search through</strong> (I'll search through one week
starting on the 11th of August 2025 and ending on the 17th) and set the
<strong>Max Advances to 0</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Setting up for a TID/SID search" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage16.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now there's 3 more checkboxes with fields next to them labeled <strong>PID</strong>,
<strong>TID</strong> and <strong>SID</strong>. The <strong>SID field you basically never want to use</strong>
unless you have a HIGHLY specific purpose for it (mainly would be used
to nickname event Pokemon as that requires matching TID, SID, trainer
name, trainer gender and game of origin). </p>
<p>The <strong>PID field is for when
you wish to prepare your savefile to easily</strong> be able to <strong>get</strong> e.g.
<strong>a 5/6 IV Starter</strong> and the <strong>TID field</strong> <strong>is for</strong> <strong>when you wish to
get a specific number Trainer ID</strong>. Neither of those two are required
but in this example I will check off both boxes inputting the PID of the
6IV Adamant Starter I prepared and the TID number of 55000 just because
I think it's a funny number.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="TID SID Search with the PID I wanted" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage39.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>If you wish to get a number that starts with any 0's such as 00555, be
aware that PokeFinder will only let you input the 555 as it has the
exact same value as 00555; once you successfully RNG it to be your
savefiles TID, it'll show up as 00555 as expected (05050 for example is
input as 5050; only 0's at the front of a number before any not-0 number
can be ignored). </p>
<p>The <strong>Static/Wild checkbox</strong> is required to check off
if you were to prepare for a Stationary or Wild encounters PID to turn
shiny, but you're probably preparing for either nothing or the Starter
(Gift encounter), <strong>so no need to check off that box</strong>. <strong>Then you can
click Search</strong> and if you searched for nothing specific at all or only
searched for either a specific TID number or a specific PID to be turned
shiny, but not both, you will most definitely get several results
already. But if for example you search for both a TID and a PID, you may
not have gotten any results right now in which case you have 3 options:</p>
<p>1. Increase the date range you search through.</p>
<p>2. Increase Max Advances. Whilst Advances will make each attempt take a
bit longer, even just 5 of them will have PokeFinder search through
significantly more results so I'll put them to 5. I'd say doing up to 10
is generally within reason. I will explain how to actually do Advances
later.</p>
<p>3. Increase Keypresses in your profile. I'm already at 0-4 but 5 is
still usually doable just fine whilst 6, 7 or 8 are sometimes not
humanly feasible.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My selected ID with updated settings" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage22.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now with at least one target seed found, you must choose which to pick.
Generally I recommend to prioritize aiming for something with a low
target second so like 16-31 on DS/Lite/i and 40-55 on 3DS models). In my
case I only got a single one so I have no choice but to take it (or
search another date range/more Advances/add more Keypresses). </p>
<p>Since I
put the Max Advances to 0, I'll not have to advance at all myself but if
you did have to increase the Max Advances, the amount of Advances you
have to do yourself is calculated by subtracting the Initial Advances
from the Advances. If the Initial Advances were 30 for example and the
Advances were 34, I'd later have to do 34-30=4 manual Advances myself.
There's also 2 Keypresses in the B and Start buttons that I'll have to
press during startup of the game later.</p>
<h2 id="the-rng-process-1">The RNG Process</h2>
<p>Open up <strong>EonTimer</strong> and there <strong>put the Target Second to your seeds
seconds</strong> (6 in my case), <strong>go into the DS menu to change the date to
the target date</strong> (here the 12th of August 2025) <strong>and get ready to
change and confirm the target time</strong> (normally it'd be 02:49 for me with
that target seed, however EonTimer says &quot;<strong>Minutes Before Target: 1</strong>&quot;
so I need to put the time to a minute earlier in 02:48 on my DS; this is
due to 6 being too low of a target second to feasibly hit, so EonTimer
adds a full minute to the time).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Minutes before target" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage32.png" width="60%"></center>
<div class="tabcontainer" num="2">
<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active"  onclick="openCity(event, 1, 2)" >DS</button>
  <button class="tablinks"         onclick="openCity(event, 2, 2)">DSi</button>
  <button class="tablinks"         onclick="openCity(event, 3, 2)">3DS</button>
</div>
<div id="1" class="tabcontent active">
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="DS Date & Time" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage20.png" width="60%"></center>
</div>
<div id="2" class="tabcontent">

<div id="3" class="tabcontent">
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="3DS Date & Time" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage19.png" width="60%"></center>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>At the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,
press the Start button in EonTimer</strong>. Now go back to the home menu, get
ready to <strong>start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer
sounds</strong> and make sure to <strong>press and hold any buttons your target seed
may require</strong> (start pressing the buttons right after you started the
game and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will
need to press and hold the B and Start buttons).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where it's okay to press A" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage27.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Now continue on selecting the &quot;<strong>NEW GAME</strong>&quot; option, <strong>go through the
introduction sequence</strong>, choose your gender and name yourself. After
confirming your name on the bottom screen by clicking on OK, <strong>Professor
Juniper will ask you whether she got your name right and this is the
moment you can Advance the RNG</strong> if your target ID pair requires any
Advances.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Where to press no" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage7.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In my case I don't need to do any Advances but if you had to do e.g. 4
Advances, you'd say &quot;No&quot; to her question a total of 4 times. <strong>Each time
you say &quot;No&quot; when Juniper asks you this, the RNG Advances by 1</strong> so do
this however often is required for your target ID pair. You also get to
name your rival in these games but saying &quot;No&quot; to Juniper when she asks
you whether she got his name correct will not advance the RNG. </p>
<p>After
you're done with advancing you can <strong>finish up the introduction and as
soon as you can move your character</strong>, open up the menu by pressing X,
go to the trainer card option (will just be named whatever you named
yourself; has a yellow card symbol) and flip the card on its back using
the flip <img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage12.png"> button to <strong>see what TID you got</strong>. I<strong>f
you got your target TID number</strong> congratulations, <strong>you</strong> just
successfully RNG manipulated your TID/SID and <strong>can now skip to the
&quot;Next Steps...&quot; section</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-1">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>If it is not your target TID number however, you first gotta find out
what else you may have hit</strong> to make sure nothing else went wrong. Start
by <strong>opening the</strong> Profile Manager at the top. Here <strong>create a new
profile that is an exact copy of the profile of the game that you have
been using</strong> for this IDrng as of yet, <strong>but with one difference</strong>: for
the <strong>Min and Max Timer0,</strong> <strong>check out what Timer0's you have gotten
during profile calibration and input the lowest value -1 as the Min and
the highest value +1 as the Max</strong> (if you got e.g. 1102, 1103, 1104,
1105, 1106, 1107, 1108 and 1109 as Timer0's, put the range to 1101-110A.
If you did not write down all the Timer0's you can get or you lost the
writeup, put the range to your most common Timer0 - and + 16. So if 1106
was your most common Timer0, put the range to 10F6 Min and 1116 Max.
I'll name this new profile &quot;B2 Phat Eng Troubleshooting&quot; since it's for
troubleshooting my English Black 2 game that I RNG with on my DS (<strong>If
you are using one of the DSi/3DS consoles that can have 2 different
VCounts</strong>, you'll need to <strong>make 2 of these profiles</strong> each having 1 of
the two VCounts you can get).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Troubleshooting profile" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage3.png" width="100%"></center>
<p><strong>This profile will ONLY be for troubleshooting.</strong> <strong>Whenever you search
for a target seed, you should always select your main profile</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Save the profile</strong>, go <strong>back to the IDs window</strong>, <strong>select this newly
created profile</strong> and now <strong>input the TID you got into the right half of
PokeFinders IDrng</strong> <strong>section</strong> labeled &quot;<strong>Seed Finder</strong>&quot;, put the
<strong>date</strong>, <strong>hour</strong> and <strong>minute</strong> to that <strong>of your target seed</strong>, the
<strong>Second Range to be +/-1 of your target second</strong> if you're <strong>on
DS/Lite/i</strong> and <strong>+/-3 if you're on 3DS</strong> models (so 5-7 for me since my
target is 6 and I'm on a DS) and <strong>put the Max Advances to the amount
you need to do +1</strong> (so 0+1=1 in my case). Now <strong>press the Find button</strong>
and you should be presented with at least 1 result.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Finding which Timer0 I hit" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage18.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>If there's nothing that likely means you did something wrong. Double
check all the date and time settings match in both PokeFinder and on
your DS. After you checked simply try again whether you noticed
something or not and if you still get nothing, calibrate your profile
one more attempt to make sure you didn't accidentally write down the
wrong VCount or something. If after all that you still cannot seem to
get anything, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RA7xKVPqg"><em>im a blisy ._.</em>'s RNG manip assistance Discord
server</a>
and ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel <strong>providing an explanation of
the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder IDs window and
EonTimer</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do get a result, you now need to check whether it's sensible by
having a look at the Advances. Optimally whatever you hit should have
the exact same Keypresses your target ID has and the difference between
the Advances and the Initial Advances columns should match the amount of
manual Advances you did, but since we're all only human and can e.g.
miscount, if it's 1 Advance too much or 1 too little it's likely still
valid. Also have a look at the second you hit vs the second you
targeted. Normally on DS, Lite and i you should always hit your exact
target second whilst on 3DS models hitting 1 off is fairly common. If
the result is off any more than that, do 1 more <a href="/bw/beginner/calibration">Profile Calibration</a> and adjust your EonTimer with the second
you hit instead of your target if needed.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="TID/SID I hit" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage2.png" width="60%"></center>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="TID/SID In PokeFinder" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage28.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In my first attempt I hit a TID of 21775 which I get 2 results for. I
know the first one is the one I hit because the Keypresses match and
36-36=0 which matches the amount of Advances I did precisely as well.
The second I hit is also 6 just like my target but the Timer0 I hit is
1107 instead of my target 1106. That'll just happen a fair lot in BW2;
nothing I can do about that except try again and hope I won't get
Timer0'd too much. <strong>Whilst in theory this is a valid hit and</strong> if I
didn't care for my TID to be 55000 specifically (and didn't want a 5/6IV
shiny Starter) <strong>I could just proceed now being done with TID/SID RNG, I
would advise against it</strong>. </p>
<p>The amount of times I've seen people who
thought they got an ID pair just because PokeFinder displayed it to them
when in reality something went wrong making them unable to get e.g. a
shiny Starter later is in the dozens. <strong>I ALWAYS recommend people to
continue until they get the specific TID/SID pair they originally aimed
for</strong>. That is the only way to ensure you did indeed get what PokeFinder
tells you you got and with IDrng being one of the easiest RNGs in BW2
it's not gonna take particularly long or be very difficult to
successfully do either in comparison to other BW2 RNGs. So now you just
<strong>rinse and repeat this RNG until you get your desired ID pair</strong>; due to
the volatility of the Timer0 in BW2 it's not unlikely you'll have to do
10 or more attempts depending on your luck (also will be more on 3DS
models due to the inconsistency with the seconds you hit).</p>
<h2 id="updating-the-profile-1">Updating the Profile</h2>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="My target SID" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage4.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>After 7 attempts I got my target ID of 55000! Now all that's left to do
is go to the Profile Manager at the top left of the IDs window and edit
our profile by inputting the TID/SID pair we got.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Updating my profile" src="/bw/beginner/tidsidimage33.png" width="100%"></center> </div>

<p><strong>And with our TID/SID successfully RNGd</strong>, we can now <strong>save the
