                <h2 id="overview"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Anchor link for: overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This is a much more complex RNG to prepare for than the Starter but it
may be worth it as this is the only way to get a shiny Tornadus or
Thundurus in Gen 5. In the future this will be part of a proper full
Roamer RNG guide but until that one's done, this will have to do.</p>
<p>There's 2 different ways you could prepare for it: the <strong>safe</strong> and the
<strong>risky way</strong>.</p>
<p>The risky way works very similar to how preparation for the Starter
works, however what makes it so risky here is that some Advances are
completely unreachable when doing Roamer RNG specifically, and you can
never know which Advances those are until you actually do the Roamer
RNG. This is why <strong>I would recommend you do not use the risky way</strong>
(though I will still explain it since it <em>can</em> work if you're fairly
lucky and the safe way takes a lot more time to prepare than the risky
way).</p>
<p>Click safe way or Risky way on the side bar to choose your method.(please use the safe way
for your own sanity's sake).</p>
<h2 id="safe-way"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#safe-way" aria-label="Anchor link for: safe-way">Safe Way</a></h2>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#setup" aria-label="Anchor link for: setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>To start the safe way, you'll want to <strong>open up Pokefinder</strong>, go to the
<strong>Gen 5 tab</strong> and once there open the <strong>Static option</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="PokeFinder main window" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage2.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>In the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the <strong>profile</strong> of the
game you wish to do this in <strong>is selected</strong> and right below the profile
option <strong>switch to the searcher tab</strong> in which there's 3 different
sections labeled &quot;<strong>RNG Info</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Settings</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Filters</strong>&quot;.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Setup for searcher" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage24.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>In the <strong>RNG Info section</strong> put the <strong>Initial Advances to 1715</strong> if
you're <strong>on Black 1</strong> or to <strong>420</strong> if you're <strong>on White 1</strong> (I use
Black 1 for this example), put the <strong>Max Advances to 20</strong> and <strong>input a
date range you wish to search through</strong> (I personally would pick the
full current month) whilst <strong>leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV
Advances and Lucky Power all at 0.</strong></p>
<p>Next in the <strong>Settings section</strong>,
select the <strong>Roamers Category</strong> which will automatically select your
versions Roamer and finally in the <strong>Filters section</strong> input your
<strong>desired IVs, Hidden Power</strong> (which fully depends on IVs <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/hidden-power-iv-combinations.78083/">Hidden Power
IV Combinations. | Smogon
Forums</a>)
<strong>and Nature</strong>. Do <strong>not</strong> search for a <strong>Shiny</strong> but just leave that
option at &quot;<strong>any</strong>&quot; as you're trying to find a not-shiny Advance that
you can later turn shiny with a TID/SID combination.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Searcher settings" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage20.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>The Initial Advances sit at those oddly specific seeming numbers because
<strong>Route 7 can have different weather on it</strong> depending on the season and
precise date (Clear weather which is just the absence of any of the
three following weathers, Rain, Hail or Snow). When you exit the house
on Route 7 to start the Roamer cutscene, whichever weather there is on
your current target date will appear until Tornadus/Thundurus descends
from the sky. Rain, Hail and Snow all advance the RNG forward fairly
quickly at different speeds making you hit a far later Advance than if
the weather was Clear. </p>
<p>Now you'd think why don't we just pick a target
date with Clear weather then and for White 1 and Thundurus you'd be
right as Clear is the optimal weather, however if you're going for
Tornadus in Black 1 you actually want it to specifically Rain
beforehand. This is because, for some unknown reason, the Rain Cutscene
that Tornadus summons will sometimes extend way past its usual duration
and make you hit an Advance several dozen to even 200-300 Advances later
than expected. This phenomenon happens by far the least often when it
already rained on the route just before Tornadus descends from the sky.</p>
<p>So for <strong>Tornadus</strong> you want a <strong>Rainy day</strong>, which on average Advances
by around 1705 between you exiting the house and Tornadus generating,
whilst for <strong>Thundurus</strong> you want a target date on a <strong>Clear day</strong>,
which on average Advances by around 410 between you exiting the house
and Thundurus generating. You should start searching at 1715/420 with 20
Max Advances (the Max Advances start counting from the Initial Advances
making the range it searches 1715-1735/420-440) instead of 1705/410 to
have at least 10 Advances to confirm the seed you're on using
Chatot/saving and then be able to find the Nature you want by stopping
on an Advance not too far away (20 at most in this case). Which days of
what seasons it Rains, Snows and Hails on on Route 7 you can see in this
table (for some reason only Winter months have variation):</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="safe weathers" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage12.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Seasons cycle through three times per year. So January is Spring,
February Summer, March Autumn, April Winter and then in May it goes back
to Spring etc. (Data from the Bulbapedias Rain and Hail articles
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rain#On_the_field">Rain - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>,
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hail_(weather_condition)#On_the_field">Hail (weather condition) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>).</p>
<p>Since Summer has the by far most Clear days and Spring and Autumn have
the by far most Rainy days, I recommend to <strong>search through</strong> any <strong>1
full Spring or Autumn month</strong> of your choice <strong>for Tornadus or</strong> any <strong>1
full Summer month</strong> of your choice <strong>for Thundurus</strong>.<br />
With all the fields now filled out, <strong>press search</strong>. </p>
<p>If you get no
results you can either search through another month, increase Max
Advances (will make each attempt take longer later and since you'll most
likely have to do this several times, I'd not recommend it) or enable
more Keypresses in your profile (I recommend to have at least none, 1, 2
and 3 Keypresses enabled and maybe even 4 and 5 too. But no more than 5
unless you have more than 10 fingers lol; you may need to search through
several months before finding a suitable target seed when looking for 6
specific IVs as it's pretty rare. With only 5 specific IVs and up to 5
Keypresses, a single month should likely produce several results
though).</p>
<p>With a few results found to make it much easier to hit the desired
nature later, there's several more things to account for. Start by
looking for a <strong>cluster of 2 or more different Advances</strong> that all
happen <strong>on the same seed</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Safe cluster" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage23.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Next up you'll want to <strong>have a look at</strong> each of <strong>those 2+ Advances
Characteristics</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Characteristics" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage16.png" width="100%"></center>
<p><strong>They must be different</strong> for you to later be able to tell exactly what
Advance you hit. If you get the same Characteristic on two or more
different Advances, those Advances no longer count towards the 2+
required different ones (so if there's 4 Advances on the same seed where
the first one is 'Mischievous', the second 'Alert to sounds', the third
'Capable of taking hits' and the fourth 'Alert to sounds' again, that
seed would only count as having 2 different Advances, as the first and
third ones are indistinguishable from each other for us later). </p>
<p>From a
few test searches it seems that getting more than 2 properly different
ones (with different and not repeated Characteristics) is fairly rare
(or extremely rare if you're looking for a 6IV target instead of a 5IV
like I did in this example), so if you can only find ones with 2 in a
row you can either just take it and hope you can hit either of the two,
or what I would rather recommend search through a few different months
to try and find one with 3 (or more; but 3 is good already) as that will
make hitting one of the desired Nature Advances likely a fair lot
faster. This is also why going for less than 5/6 perfect IVs is more
difficult here; will give you less different Characteristics.</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: Read this if you're going for a specific Hidden Power.</summary>
<p>Some
Hidden Power types make this more restricted. Hidden Power Water for
example requires you to have at most 3 of the same highest IV stat which
then means that the maximum different Advances we can use are 3 as
Characteristics are determined by the highest IV stat or if there's
multiple equally high ones it's determined by those + the PID. Hidden
Power Poison is a more extreme example as you can only choose between
having 1 or 2 of the same equally highest IV stat giving you no option
to go for 3 or more different Characteristics.</p>
</details>
<p>After that <strong>make sure the seed is on a date with the recommended
weather</strong> (which mine is as the 4th of July is a Rainy Autumn day).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Date being correct" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage26.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>To finish up the target seed selection, you also need to <strong>check the
specific time of the seed</strong>. This is because after you RNG the Roamer,
it'll start wandering through the region, and where exactly it goes
depends on your current time of day and the season (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Roaming_Pok%C3%A9mon#Generation_V_2">Roaming
Pokémon</a>,
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time#Time_of_day_in_relation_to_season">Time - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage4.png" width="80%"></center>
<p><br />
Since after the 8th gym you do not yet have access to Routes 11, 12, 13,
14 and 15, you will want to <strong>make sure that either your target seed is
not in the early morning hours or that you remember to beat Ghetsis
first and explore some of the east of Unova before starting the actual
ingame testing phase</strong> of this preparation (the late evening is fine as
you can just go back and forth between routes until it is on Routes 9 or
10 and not 11). For my Black Version Tornadus RNG I will choose the
shown 5IV, 25 Attack seed on the 4th of July 2025, at 21:53:36 with the
Keypresses R + L + B + Left that has 3 different Timid Nature Advances
on 1772, 1773 and 1777 all with different Characteristics.</p>
<p>With a proper target seed selected, <strong>save its info somewhere</strong> (e.g. in
the form of a screenshot of the searcher window) and then we can finally
get into how to actually execute this safe way. Here you will want to
basically <strong>speedrun the game</strong> (not literally; just be fast to not
waste your own time) without doing any RNG at all (again to not waste
time) <strong>until</strong> you can summon the Roamer <strong>after the 8th gym</strong>. Once
you try to go to Route 10 after beating the Opelucid Gym, the worker
inside the Gate will stop you and tell you about a storm. This means
that Tornadus/Thundurus is now available for encountering on Route 7.
Don't go there just yet though, as there's a few more things to do
before starting. <strong>Having</strong> at least 1 but preferably <strong>2 Chatot and a
Master Ball will make this a fair lot easier and faster</strong> <strong>but are
not</strong> absolutely <strong>required</strong>. </p>
<p>You can get Chatot either via trading
locally from another Gen 5 game you or a friend may have, from trading
online via fan hosted servers (<a href="https://pkmnclassic.net/">Poké Classic
Network</a>) or by putting some into
your Entree Forest using the program &quot;Entralinked&quot; mentioned at the
beginning of this guide (technically only legal in BW1 as the Dream
World could not spawn Chatot for connected BW2 games originally).</p>
<p>Another thing to <strong>watch out for</strong> is in regards to <strong>the ingame
season</strong>. The Game only updates your current season whenever you leave a
building or cave, or when crossing between two outdoor maps at a
transition that involves a loading zone (such as by moving between the
various sections of Castelia City). <strong>The game</strong> also <strong>remembers what
your season was when you last saved.</strong> This can become an issue since
the process of doing Roamer RNG involves exiting the house on Route 7 on
a certain Advance after which a cutscene will take over immediately and
since you are exiting a building, the game will update the current
season up to 3 times (depending on both the season you saved in and the
season of your target date) during which the two randomly moving NPCs on
the Route can already advance the RNG adding more inconsistency to an
already inconsistent RNG. </p>
<p>So <strong>to minimize the NPC issue, you need to
change your current season to your target season</strong> (if it isn't the same
already) by e.g. putting your console date to your target date, loading
the game, going into some building or cave, leaving it and then watching
as the season gets updated.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Season update" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage29.gif" width="60%"></center>
<p>After that you can <strong>finally go into the house on Route 7</strong> (make sure
to bring your Chatot with you if you have any and optimally leave 1
empty space in your party) and once inside <strong>save the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Now back to PokeFinder, open the <strong>Gen 5 Static option</strong> and <strong>select
your game's profile</strong> if it isn't already. <strong>Paste your target seed</strong>
<strong>into the</strong> Generators <strong>Seed field</strong> (if you have not closed
PokeFinder since you found your target seed, you'll need to switch to
the Generator in the top left), put the <strong>Max Advances to 30</strong>, select
the <strong>Roamers Category</strong> and <strong>press the Generate button</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Generator setup" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage25.png" width="100%"></center>
<h2 id="testing-process"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#testing-process" aria-label="Anchor link for: testing-process">Testing Process</a></h2>
<p>Open up <strong>EonTimer</strong> and <strong>put the Target Second to that of your target
seed</strong> (in my case it's 36 as my target time is 21:53:36; your
calibration value you should already have found during profile
calibration).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Eontimer setup" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage9.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>Then go to the <strong>menu of your DS</strong> to <strong>change the date to that of your
target seed</strong> and get ready to <strong>change the time</strong> to the proper one as
well (if EonTimer says you need to set the time to 1 minute before
target, put it 1 minute earlier than usual so if your target time was
12:30:05 and EonTimer says &quot;<strong>Minutes Before Target: 1</strong>&quot;, put it to
12:29 in your DS).</p>

the D-pad).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="when to press A" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage6.png" width="60%"></center>
<p>The moment you see this star, you can continue to get into the game.
Just before you can get in, the <strong>C-Gear popup</strong> will appear and you
<strong>must deactivate</strong> it upon entering the game as it would otherwise
screw with the RNG.</p>
<p>Once ingame, <strong>open your party and listen to 10 Chatot cries in a row
comparing what you hear to what each Advance in PokeFinder shows</strong>.</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: How does using Chatter or saving to advance the RNG work?</summary> 
<p>The
way the Chatter works is that you first have to use Chatter as a field
move and can then record a custom sound onto it; Chatot learns Chatter
at level 21. With such a custom Chatter recorded, whenever you view the
summary of a Chatot, the game picks a value between 0-99 at random
(which is why it Advances the RNG forward by 1 each time) and depending
on how high of a number it rolls, the Chatter will sound anywhere from
very deep (lower value) to very high (higher value).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="chatot order" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage21.png" ></center>
<p>In my case the first Advance on my seed, Advance 49 (likely a different
number for you), is pretty high with a value of 84 and the Advance
number 50 after has an even higher Chatter with a value of 98 (the
letters H, MH, M, ML and L stand for High, Medium High, Medium, Medium
Low and Low). Generally we humans can not differentiate between closeby
values like my Advances 51 and 52 which have values of 61 and 56.
Instead you should try to focus on whether a Chatter sounds more high or
more low and then try to orient yourself mostly on pretty low (0-20) and
pretty high (80-99) Chatters. </p>
<p><br />
In my example the Chatters between
Advances 49-58 have values of 84, 98, 61, 56, 29, 37, 81, 5, 66, and 0
so I know that the first Chatter will sound pretty high, the second one
even higher, third, and fourth lower than the two before but still a bit
high, fifth and sixth both a bit lower than before again, the seventh
pretty high, the eighth very low, the ninth a fair bit higher again and
the tenth extremely low. The following GIF shows me flipping back and
forth between 2 Chatot 4 times to advance the RNG by 5 (+1 for opening the
summary initially and +4 due to the 4 flips). If you only have 1 Chatot,
you can just flip back and forth between it and another party member but
ofc that'll halve the advancement speed since only viewing Chatot's
summary will advance the RNG.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Chatot flipping" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage31.gif" width="40%"></center>
<p><strong>If you do not have Chatot, you can also use saving the game to advance
the RNG</strong> (though it is significantly slower). Here is a table of what
Chatter value corresponds to which save needle starting position:</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="spinners to chatot flips" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage5.png" ></center>
<p>The edge cases between 2 save needle starting positions can always be
either one of the two adjacent ones; probably due to some rounding the
game does (e.g. 12 and 13 can be either a ↑ or a ↗).</p>
<p>In my case, since the very first Advance shown has a value of 84 in the
Chatot column, the save needle would start in a left ← facing position
when saving the game (see GIF).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Save spinners" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage28.gif" width="60%"></center>
<p>If your DS does not seem to pick up any sound you can either use a
different DS to record a Chatter if you have another one or use save
needles to confirm your seed; even if no sound plays the Chatter will
still advance the RNG but it wouldn't be very helpful to us as we have
no way of knowing how high or low of a pitch each Chatter was. The
Chatter sound gets deleted whenever you deposit the last Chatot that was
still in your party into your boxes.</p>
</details>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Chatot order" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage11.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>Here's what the first 10 Chatot of my target seed sounded like (will
sound different depending on what you recorded. This is just an example;
with the Route 7 music in the Background since you can't turn it off):</p>
<center>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/bw/extra credit/first10audiochatters.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
</center>
<p>If the Chatters (/save needles) do not seem to line up at all, simply
try again beginning with changing the time back to the target value and
starting EonTimer. If on a second attempt it also does not seem to
match, double check all date and time settings match your target, make
sure you accounted for any minutes before target if EonTimer tells you
you need them and check if all the buttons you may need to press and
hold are working properly. If you find nothing wrong, try a third time
and if it still doesn't match, do 1 profile calibration run with this
target date, time and Keypresses (only works with up to 3 Keypresses. If
you have more just leave as many out as needed until there's only 3
left) to check whether you're at least just getting Timer0'd (aka the
game is only giving you your usually rarer Timer0) or whether something
else is wrong. If you get a valid result that looks like your usual
calibration (possibly with the Timer0 being slightly different by 1 hex
value), you're just getting Timer0'd and have the choice between either
continuing to try as you will get it eventually or trying out another
target seed hoping that one will be more merciful with the Timer0 (I
would probably do ~5 more attempts and if you still couldn't hit it I'd
recommend trying another seed as some date/time/Keypress combinations
may have your usually less common Timer0 be much more common making this
RNG take much longer than normal).</p>
<p><strong>After</strong> having done these <strong>10 Advances</strong> and being sure you're on the
right seed, <strong>you can continue advancing towards your target</strong> if need
be. <strong>Take any of the 2-5 Advances with your desired nature</strong> (in my
case I'll pick the 1773 one as having some desired Advances above at
1777 and below at 1772 would make it a bit more likely to hit one of
them) <strong>and subtract 1705</strong> from it if you're <strong>on Black 1 or 410</strong> if
you're <strong>on White 1</strong>. In my case this gets me to Advance 1773-1705=68
so <strong>that's the Advance I'll want to stop on</strong> on this first attempt. I
do the remaining Chatot until I hear the Chatter of Advance 68
(following along each Advance's Chatter pitch one by one to not lose
track) and <strong>then exit the house</strong>. Right after exiting the house, the
cutscene will begin. </p>
<p><strong>Once Tornadus/Thundurus descends from the sky,
start spamming A</strong>, as you spamming it is the by far easiest way to make
sure your timing on when you close the 2 textboxes that will appear
shortly is consistent and consistency is key. The first textbox is just
the Pokemons scream and the second textbox has 2 parts to it saying
something about the storm. Once that second textbox is gone and
Tornadus/Thundurus has flown away, you can stop spamming the A button.
The Storm will last a few seconds longer and after it stops you can go
and hunt down Tornadus/Thundurus (remember that where it appears depends
on your current time of day and to a lesser extent season). The in my
opinion best way to get it is to just go to the gate adjacent to a Route
Tornadus/Thundurus can be on at your current time of day and then just
go back and forth between the Route and Gate until the Storm appears
(since it's around 22:00 ingame for me, it can appear on Routes 9, 10
and 11 and I will be in the gate at Route 9).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Finding the roamer" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage30.gif" width="60%"></center>
<p>Once the Storm is on the Route, run around in the grass until you
encounter Tornadus/Thundurus (having a repel active with a Pokemon
that's very close in level but not higher than Tornadus/Thundurus which
are at level 40 at the front of your party will make this faster). Now
<strong>catch it</strong> (with e.g. a Master Ball) <strong>and have a look at its Nature
and Characteristic</strong>.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Roamer I caught" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage10.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>Excuse the german but in my case I got a Bold Nature (Kühn in german)
and its Characteristic is &quot;Alert to sounds&quot; (Achtet auf Geräusche in
german).</p>
<details>
<summary>Note: Natures and Characteristics in other languages.</summary> 
<p>You can change
the language of PokeFinder to whatever language your game is in by going
to Tools and then Settings and it'll display that language's names for
all the Natures and Characteristics.</p>
</details>
<p>That is ofc not what I wanted but that's ok and to be expected due to
the inconsistency of this RNG. We want to <strong>repeat this as often as
necessary until we hit the nature that we want</strong> our Tornadus/Thundurus
to have later on (with a not repeated Characteristic). Trying <strong>to stop
on the exact same Advance multiple times is completely useless</strong> as
that'll always yield the exact same Advance you hit assuming you spammed
A consistently throughout the cutscene textboxes. Instead you'll want to
<strong>try the +/-10 surrounding Advances</strong> in any order of your liking.
Since I started at 68, I'll try stopping on 69 next, then 67, 70, 66
etc. always going 1 more Advance up and then 1 more Advance down until I
get my desired Timid Nature. </p>
<p>What else you hit instead of your desired
Nature also doesn't matter so if it's not the correct one you can just
immediately go back to the console's date and time settings to try
again; do make sure to <strong>write down which Advances you tried already</strong>
though to not waste time trying the same ones several times on accident.
It'll probably take around 5-15 attempts but it can be more or less
depending on your luck and if you have incredibly awful luck, all 2-5 of
the Advances with your desired nature may be impossible to hit. After
having tried the +/-10 Advances if you did not get your desired nature
yet, try another 5 in both directions. If you still didn't get it, it's
probably best to try another target seed (in the same season).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="Second tornadus" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage22.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>I got one of my seeds Timid Advances after 11 attempts which is about
average luck. I stopped on Advance 63 that attempt and got the one on
1772. <strong>I know that's the one because it was the only one that's nearby
with a Timid Nature and Often dozes off as the Characteristics</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For
English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were
changed in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for
these, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar
issue but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's
Characteristics change so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you
may have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokemon wiki site of
your language for example.</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt=Characteristics"" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage3.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>With my desired Nature now hit and me knowing which Advance exactly that
is, I'll <strong>try stopping on the same Advance 2 more times to make sure
it's consistent</strong>. And with that the preparation for getting a perfect
IV shiny Roamer the safe way is done. If you haven't already, <strong>save the
target seed info somewhere</strong> (e.g. in the form of a screenshot of the
searcher window) <strong>and</strong> then <strong>copy the PID of the Advance that you
hit</strong> (you can e.g. just click on the PID of your hit Advance in the
generated results and use ctrl+c to copy it; FBF114D0 in my case since I
hit Advance 1772).</p>

<p>In the <strong>RNG Info section</strong> put the <strong>Initial Advances to 1715</strong> if
you're <strong>on Black 1</strong> or to <strong>420</strong> if you're <strong>on White 1</strong> (I use
Black 1 for this example), put the <strong>Max Advances to 10</strong> and <strong>input a
date range you wish to search through</strong> (I personally would pick the
full current month) whilst <strong>leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV
Advances and Lucky Power all at 0.</strong> Next in the <strong>Settings section</strong>,
select the <strong>Roamers Category</strong> which will automatically select your
versions Roamer and finally in the <strong>Filters section</strong> input your
<strong>desired IVs, Hidden Power</strong> (which fully depends on IVs <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/hidden-power-iv-combinations.78083/">Hidden Power
IV Combinations. | Smogon Forums</a>)
<strong>and Nature</strong>. Do <strong>not</strong> search for a <strong>Shiny</strong> but just leave that
option at &quot;<strong>any</strong>&quot; as you're trying to find a not-shiny Advance that
you can later turn shiny with a TID/SID combination.</p>

<p>The Initial Advances sit at those oddly specific seeming numbers because
<strong>Route 7 can have different weather on it</strong> depending on the season and
precise date (Clear weather which is just the absence of any of the
three following weathers, Rain, Hail or Snow). When you exit the house
on Route 7 to start the Roamer cutscene, whichever weather there is on
your current target date will appear until Tornadus/Thundurus descends
from the sky. Rain, Hail and Snow all advance the RNG forward fairly
quickly at different speeds making you hit a far later Advance than if
the weather was Clear. Now you'd think why don't we just pick a target
date with Clear weather then and for White 1 and Thundurus you'd be
right as Clear is the optimal weather, however if you're going for
Tornadus in Black 1 you actually want it to specifically Rain
beforehand. This is because, for some unknown reason, the Rain Cutscene
that Tornadus summons will sometimes extend way past its usual duration
and make you hit an Advance several dozen to even 200-300 Advances later
than expected. This phenomenon happens by far the least often when it
already rained on the route just before Tornadus descends from the sky.</p>
<p>So for <strong>Tornadus</strong> you want a <strong>Rainy day</strong>, which on average Advances
by around 1705 between you exiting the house and Tornadus generating,
whilst for <strong>Thundurus</strong> you want a target date on a <strong>Clear day</strong>,
which on average Advances by around 410 between you exiting the house
and Thundurus generating. You should start searching at 1715/420 with 10
Max Advances (the Max Advances start counting from the Initial Advances
making the range it searches 1715-1725/420-430) instead of 1705/410 to
have at least 10 Advances to confirm the seed you're on using
Chatot/saving and then be able to find the Nature you want by stopping
on an Advance not too far away (10 at most in this case). Which days of
what seasons it Rains, Snows and Hails on on Route 7 you can see in this
table (for some reason only Winter months have variation):</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage12.png" width="90%"></center>
<p>Seasons cycle through three times per year. So January is Spring,
February Summer, March Autumn, April Winter and then in May it goes back
to Spring etc. (Data from the Bulbapedias Rain and Hail articles
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rain#On_the_field">Rain - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>,
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hail_(weather_condition)#On_the_field">Hail (weather condition) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>).</p>
<p>Since Summer has the by far most Clear days and Spring and Autumn have
the by far most Rainy days, I recommend to <strong>search through</strong> any <strong>1
full Spring or Autumn month</strong> of your choice <strong>for Tornadus or</strong> any <strong>1
full Summer month</strong> of your choice <strong>for Thundurus</strong>.<br />
With all the fields now filled out, <strong>press search</strong>. If you get no
results you can either search through another month, increase Max
Advances (will make each attempt take longer later and since you'll most
likely have to do this several times, I'd not recommend it) or enable
more Keypresses in your profile (I recommend to have at least none, 1, 2
and 3 Keypresses enabled and maybe even 4 and 5 too. But no more than 5
unless you have more than 10 fingers lol; you may need to search through
several months before finding a suitable target seed when looking for 6
specific IVs as it's pretty rare. With only 5 specific IVs and up to 5
Keypresses, a single month should likely produce several results
though).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage19.png" width="100%"></center>
<p>With a few results found, there's one more thing to pay attention to and
that is <strong>the specific time of your target seed</strong>. This is because after
you RNG the Roamer, it'll start wandering through the region, and where
exactly it goes depends on your current time of day and the season
(<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Roaming_Pok%C3%A9mon#Generation_V_2">Roaming
Pokémon</a>,
<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time#Time_of_day_in_relation_to_season">Time - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon
encyclopedia</a>).</p>
<center><img class="myImages" id="myImg" alt="" src="/bw/extra credit/roamerimage4.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>And since after the 8th gym you do not yet have access to Routes 11, 12,
13, 14 and 15, <strong>you will want to make sure that either your target seed
is not in the early morning hours or that you later remember to beat
Ghetsis first and explore some of the east of Unova before starting the
Roamer RNG</strong> later (the late evening is fine as you can just go back and
forth between routes until it is on Routes 9 or 10 and not 11). For my
Black Version Tornadus RNG I will choose the shown 5IV, 25 Attack seed
on the 4th of July 2025, which is a Rainy day, at 21:53:36 with the
Keypresses R + L + B + Left that has a Timid Nature on Advance 1772.</p>
<p>And with that the preparation for getting a perfect IV shiny Roamer the
risky way is done. This guide will not explain how to do the actual
Roamer RNG later as that is a subject for its own guide. If you haven't
already, <strong>save the target seed info somewhere</strong> (e.g. in the form of a
screenshot of the searcher window) <strong>and</strong> then <strong>copy the PID of the
target</strong> (you can e.g. just click on the PID of your hit Advance in the
generated results and use ctrl+c to copy it; FBF114D0 in my case).</p>

<h2 id="next-steps"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Anchor link for: next-steps">Next Steps...</a></h2>
<p>You can now return to the <a href="/bw/beginner/tidsid/">TID/SID RNG guide</a> and
RNG for an ID pair that makes the PID of the Roamer you found shiny.</p>
