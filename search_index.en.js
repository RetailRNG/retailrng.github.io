info","id":"https://retailrng.com/article/","title":"Articles"},"https://retailrng.com/article/gen3sunusedflashmemorysection/":{"body":"A big issue I had with my original E-Reader events was space. I did not have enough of it!\nThe gen 3 games have a few defined spaces in the players save file for info obtained externally. \nThese are things like secret bases from other players, other players battle tower teams, and yes, information from the E-Reader.\nThe space defined for the Eon Ticket, specifically, is called RamScript. It’s 995 bytes in size. \nFor my first 6 events, I stored all my data in that location. This includes text, script commands, and assembly code. This is hardly ideal. \nI played around with other storage solutions, but today I’m going to write about the best one I’ve found, and how to utilize it. \nWhen a Gen 3 game saves, it transfers data from the GBAs RAM to the flash memory chip on the cartridge. \nThey also divided this flash memory chip into several sectors. Each sector is 4096 bytes, although some are lumped together. \nSectors 0-13 are for your save file.\nSectors 14-28 are for the backup of your save file\nAnd sector 29 is for your hall of fame data.\nIn Ruby &amp; Sapphire, 30 and 31 are entirely unused. \nIn Emerald, 31 is used for the battle record feature. But 30 is still unused. Or, it is, but only in international copies. \n30 is used in Japanese Emerald &amp; FRLG to store the custom trainer hill data from E-Cards. \nThis space is both unused &amp; never written to normally by the game. This means it’s 4kb of space the player can’t accidently write to by using the battle tower!\nThe game has premade functions to read from and write to the flash chip, so we don’t have to do a lot of work to use it. \nLet’s talk about writing, first. \nI use TryWriteSector, &amp; it has 2 arguments. \n\nWhich flash memory section are we using. In our case, 0x1E, aka 30.\nWhere is the data in RAM to flash?\n\nThen, when called, it writes 4096 bytes from the location you input in as the argument are written to that flash sector. \nWhen RSE connects to the E-Reader the entire e-card gets sent through the link cable into RSEs WRAM. \nThe game then looks for what’s called a “preload” script in the e-card. This is a section that runs the games scripting language commands, meant to check if the data is okay to send over.\nThe Eon Ticket, for example, checks if you already have an Eon Ticket in your bag. \nCrucially, though, it does not have a size limit.\nSo, what I do is store tons of data in the preload script. One of those being a small assembly program that sets up then calls TryWriteSector. \nLet’s take a look at what that looks like for me. This is all done using the Eon Ticket disassembly by hacky.\nAfter DataStart, I set up the preloadscript.\n\nPreloadScriptStart is where we’ll be working from, from now on. \n\nThis is the start of my preload script. callasm $02000045 jumps the game to WriteFlashMemory. Crucially, it’s after “end”, so the thumb code never gets read as script commands. \nWriteFlashMemory is the thumb assembly code I wrote to actually call TryWriteSector. It’s stored as machine code in an include file with the macros for the script commands. \nI’ll note that in Emerald, if you copy this code, the callasm should be 0201C045 instead. Emeralds spot it loads the E-Reader into is slightly different. \nHere’s what the actual code looks like:\n\nIt’s a very simple bit of code since I’m just setting up the registers for a built-in function of the game. \nAfter WriteFlashMemory, I have a bunch of code &amp; data I want to store in the unused flash memory section. \n\nAfter this the usual ramscript information begins! This is what triggers when you talk to an NPC, and it’s labeled “NormanScript”, because it’s a hack of the Eon Ticket, and you receive that from Norman. \nThis script uses several “callasm” calls, which relies on info that is within the unused flash memory section.\nThat data is not loaded into RAM anywhere by default, so we have to run a function to pull it from the flash memory section!\nIn Ruby &amp; Sapphire, since there is no Address Space Layout Randomization, I store the thumb code I need directly in RamScript near the top, like so:\n\nLet’s take a look at READFLASH. It works similarly to WriteFlashMemory, as we’re just setting up a different in-game function. It’s called DoReadFlashWholeSection in PokeRuby, &amp; ReadFlashSector in PokeEmerald.\n\nI chose 0201b201 as it doesn’t seem to be a space the game uses, but I can’t guarantee!\nBut once this thumb runs, all my code &amp; data is loaded to that space and my script can continue.\nObviously, in Emerald, this won’t work. What I do instead is store this code as writebytetoaddr commands. This, in a way, builds the thumb code live somewhere in Emeralds RAM that isn’t in ASLR space. \nEach command does what it says on the tin-- it writes the byte specified to the address specified. \nI tend to choose gEnemyParty for this, since it’s usually not in use when I’m talking to an NPC!\n\nThis is what that looks like! \nIt does eat 96 bytes into my payload, but I’m not really sure there’s a better way for Emerald. \nSpeaking of Emerald, I’ve actually taken to storing most of my events in this space, rather than ramscript. Since all the data at 0201b201 isn’t subject to ASLR, I can have the player get into battles &amp; do other things without the typical worries I’d have. \nMy Celebi event, for example, only has code in RamScript to init the unused flash memory section. All the dialogue, script, etc, is stored in the unused flash section. \n\nThat’s RamScript for Celebi. Nothing else! \nHere’s what’s in the Preload Script! It's the full source to my Celebi Event in Emerald. In Ruby &amp; Sapphire, all of this would be within RamScript itself. \n\nI think, generally, using the Unused Flash Memory section is superior to storing data elsewhere in R/S/E, and if you’re going to do any Eon Ticket hack like I have, try to use this technique for storage instead!\nFeel free to contact me if you’re trying to use this and have any questions.

To be able to RNG manipulate it,\nyou need to have done both Profile Calibration\nand TID/SID RNG already. I will be using my\nGerman copy of Black 1 for this guide.\nRecommended setup\nHardware requirements\n\n\nA BW1 game and a DS Console you have calibrated for Gen 5 RNG\nManipulation and a save file that you RNG manipulated a TID/SID pair\non.\n\n\na Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nor QT 6.8 or newer\n\n\nIn-Game requirements\n\n\nBe saved right in front of the Starter box in your character's home\nroom.\n\n\n\nTools used\n\n\nPokéFinder version 4.3.1 or newer\nPro tip: You can change the language of PokeFinder under \"Tools\" -&gt; \"Settings\"\nto fit your game's language. This will change the names of the Pokémon,\nlocations, Characteristics and Natures to be that of the game's language, which\nmay be helpful later. For some languages, UI elements are also translated (e.g.\nin German and Italian), but not for all (e.g. Japanese and Korean don't have\nfull UI translation).\n\n\nFor Windows: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.6-calibration-fix\n\n\nFor Mac &amp; Linux: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.4\n\n\nVideo example\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nPick your target\nIf you have already prepared your target during TID/SID RNG to get a\n5/6IV shiny Starter, you can skip this section and go right to the\nThe RNG Process section.\nOtherwise, you'll want to start by opening up PokeFinder, going to\nthe Gen 5 tab and once there opening the Static option.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the Gen 5 Static window's top left, make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there are 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the RNG Info section, leave the Initial IV Advances, Max IV\nAdvances and Initial Advances all at 0. The Max\nAdvances and date range depend on whether you want the Starter to just\nbe shiny or have a few perfect IVs too and whether you care about its\nmet date. If you just care for a shiny, possibly with a specific\nNature and Gender, searching through just 1 day (e.g. whatever your\n\"today\" is when reading this) with the Max Advances put to 0 will\ngive you several possible targets to go for already. \nIf you want some\nperfect IVs as well, you'll have to increase the Max Advances,\nincrease the date range and/or enable more Keypresses in your\nProfile. I do NOT recommend trying to find a 4-6IV target Seed\nthis way, as it will either require you to search through several\nmonths to maybe even years or require you to do a lot of advances (or\nboth) which are very slow since you can only use saving the game as a\nmeans to advance this early on in your adventure; if you want such\nhigh IVs + shiny, best to prepare for that during IDrng as\nexplained in the TID/SID RNG guide. \nSince I will just go for a shiny with a\nspecific Gender and Nature right now, I put my Max Advances to 0 and the\ndate range to just search through the current day as of writing this\nguide, which is the 21st of August 2025. If you also only care to get a\nshiny without any specific IVs, you can disable all but \"None\", \"1\" and\n\"2\" Keypresses in your Profile for comfort.\nNext in the Settings section, select the Starters Category\nwith the Starter you wish to RNG and finally in the Filters section\ninput your desired IVs, Gender, Nature and whether you want a shiny or\nnot.\n\nNote: What are Star and Square shinies? \nStar and Square shinies are\nONLY differentiated in Pokémon Sword and Shield specifically by having\ndifferent shiny sparkles when sent out into battle. If you either don't\nplan to transfer this Pokémon at all or intend to transfer it to\nliterally any other game (all of Gens 6, 7 and 9 + BDSP, Legends: Arceus\nand Legends: Z-A), this difference does not exist.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nNow you can hit the Search button. Once PokeFinder has found a\nresult you're happy with, you can cancel the search if it's not done\nalready. If you get no results or none you're satisfied with, you can\neither search through a different date range (e.g. the full current\nmonth), increase the Max Advances or select more possible Keypresses in\nyour Profile.\n\n  \n  \n\nI will pick this marked Adamant Female Snivy Seed here on the 21st of\nAugust 2025 at 10:17:17 because its target second in 17 is the most\ncomfortable one for me to aim for out of the options I got since I'm\nplaying on a DS Phat (same would apply on DS Lite and DSi; on 3DS going\nfor something between like 40-55 target seconds would be most\ncomfortable, though in the end it doesn't really matter what target\nsecond you aim for as this is just to make it a little bit quicker).\nSince I searched for a Seed with Max Advances of 0, I know I won't\nhave to advance the RNG at all for this, but I will explain how to\nadvance the RNG if you need to later on. There's also 2 Keypresses in\nthe Y button and the Down direction on the D-pad that I'll have to press\nand hold during startup of the game.\nThe RNG process\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seed's\nseconds (17 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date to\nthe target date (here the 21st of August 2025) and get ready to\nchange and confirm the target time (10:17 for me; should EonTimer say\n\"Minutes Before Target: 1\" and your target time is e.g. 12:30:05,\nyou'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS).\n\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu, get\nready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer\nsounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons your target Seed\nmay require (start pressing the buttons right after you started the\ngame and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will\nneed to press and hold the Y button and the Down direction on the\nD-pad).\n\nNow continue getting into the game and once you can move your\ncharacter, you have to do the advances if your target requires any. If\nyou did not search with Max Advances of 0, check out the following note.\n\nNote: Advancing the RNG for the Starter \nLet's say we searched for a target Seed using 10 Max Advances\nbecause we wanted it to have a perfect speed IV of 31.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn that case we'd copy the Seed, switch to the Generator tab, paste\nthe Seed into the Seed field and press the Generate button. Now we\nfind our target Advance (will be the one saying Star or Square in\nthe shiny column; if you searched with Max Advances higher than 11, you\nmay need to scroll a bit to find your shiny Advance. The Searcher tab\ntells you what Advance the shiny is on) and Check out how many\nAdvances it's away from the Seed's initial Advance.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn this example, the target is at Advance 49, whilst the very first\nshown Advance is at 47, meaning I'll have to do 49-47=2 Advances.\nWe can advance the RNG by saving the game. Each save advances by 1,\nso I'd save the game 2 times and then take the Starter. If you for some\nreason wanted to make things harder for yourself and get a very high IV\nStarter this way without preparing for it during TID/SID RNG, you may\nneed to aim for a very high Advance. In that case to not lose track of\nwhat Advance you're on, you can make use of the Chatot column and each\nsaves save needle starting position the same way it worked during\nProfile Calibration. Here is a table of what Chatter value corresponds\nto which save needle starting position:\n\n  \n    Chatter pitch number\n    Save Needle starting position\n  \n  \n    0-12\n    ↑\n  \n  \n    13-24\n    ↗\n  \n  \n    25-36\n    →\n  \n  \n    37-49\n    ↘\n  \n  \n    50-61\n    ↓\n  \n  \n    62-74\n    ↙\n  \n  \n    75-86\n    ←\n  \n  \n    87-99\n    ↖\n  \n\nThe edge numbers between 2 adjacent Save Needle starting positions can also\nsometimes be the other one; probably due to some rounding the game does. So\nin some cases e.g. a 12 may be a ↗ or a 13 may be a ↑ despite it usually\nbeing the other way around.\nSince the very first Advance shown here has a value of 53 in the\nChatot column, the save needle would start in a bottom ↓ facing position\nwhen saving the game. You can follow along with each Advance and then\nhave to make sure you stop 1 Advance before your target and then take\nthe Starter.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my case, that'd be Advance 48 which has a Chatot pitch of 25 leading\nto either a top right ↗ or right → facing arrow .\n\nIf you did however search with Max Advances of 0, you can just\ntake your Starter immediately. If all went well, you will have the\nshiny Starter of your dreams now in which case you can skip to the\n\"Next Steps...\" section.\nTroubleshooting\nIf your Starter did not shine, double check all date and time\nsettings match your target, make sure you accounted for any minutes\nbefore target if EonTimer tells you you need them and check if all\nthe buttons you may need to press and hold are working properly.\nThen simply try again 4-5 times by going back to the console menu,\nchanging date and time and using EonTimer to get into the game at the\ntarget second. Should it still not have shined after 4-5 attempts,\nbegin a Starter RNG attempt by loading into the game on your target\ndate/time, but instead of taking the Starter or doing Advances towards\nit, do 1 Profile Calibration attempt as explained in the Save\nNeedle Calibration section of the Profile Calibration Guide. \nIf the result of the\nProfile Calibration attempt matches your target second (or is very\nclose by; it being 1 too high or low is fairly common on 3DS models\nspecifically), but has a slightly different Timer0, you seem to be\ngetting Timer0'd (the game only gives you your other Timer0). In that\ncase you can choose between either trying out a different target Seed\nfor your Starter, as some date/time/Keypress combinations may have your\nusually less common Timer0 be much more common, making this RNG take\nmuch longer than normal, OR changing the Timer0 Min and Max in your\nProfile to both be this other Timer0 and searching for a new target Seed\nusing that.\nShould you however get no results at all, join im a blisy ._.'s RNG\nmanip assistance Discord server\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of\nthe issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder Static and\nCalibration window and EonTimer.\n\nI got my shiny Snivy after only 2 attempts!\nNext steps...\nAnd with the Starter successfully RNGd, we can now save the\ngame. And that's it; if you'd like to learn how to RNG some shiny\nLegendaries and other stationaries and gifts in this game, check out the\nStatic guide.\nThank you for reading and have fun RNGing!\n\n","description":"How to Manip a shiny Starter in BW1.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/bw1starter/","title":"BW Starter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/bw2starter/":{"body":"Overview\nThis Guide will teach you how to RNG manipulate for a shiny Starter\nPokémon in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. The BW2 Starter is probably\nthe single most annoying RNG Manipulation in all of BW2 due to the lack\nof tools in-game that early on in your adventure, the 2 randomly moving\nNPCs that are loaded in and advancing the RNG by varying amounts and the\nTimer0 being much more volatile in BW2 compared to BW1. This means it'll\nmost likely take at least a dozen, possibly a fair lot more attempts to\nget. To be able to RNG manipulate it, you need to have done both\nProfile Calibration\nand TID/SID RNG already. I will be using my English copy of\nBlack 2 for this guide.\nRecommended setup\nHardware requirements\n\n\nA BW2 game and a DS Console you have calibrated for Gen 5 RNG\nManipulation and a save file that you RNG manipulated a TID/SID pair\non.\n\n\na Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nor QT 6.8 or newer\n\n\nIn-Game requirements\n\n\nBe saved right in front of Bianca at the outlook in Aspertia City\n(Bianca has 2 dialogues up there; in the first she asks you a few\nquestions, such as whether you will help to complete the Pokedex. You\nneed to save after that first dialogue which is just before you can\ntake your Starter).\n\n\n\nTools used\n\n\nPokéFinder version 4.3.1 or newer\nPro tip: You can change the language of PokeFinder under \"Tools\" -&gt; \"Settings\"\nto fit your game's language. This will change the names of the Pokémon,\nlocations, Characteristics and Natures to be that of the game's language, which\nmay be helpful later. For some languages, UI elements are also translated (e.g.\nin German and Italian), but not for all (e.g. Japanese and Korean don't have\nfull UI translation).\n\n\nFor Windows: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.6-calibration-fix\n\n\nFor Mac &amp; Linux: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.4\n\n\nVideo example\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nPick your target\nIf you have already prepared your target during TID/SID RNG to get a\n5/6IV shiny Starter, you can skip this section and go right to the\nThe RNG Process section.\nOtherwise, you'll want to start by opening up PokeFinder, going to\nthe Gen 5 tab and once there opening the Static option.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the Gen 5 Static window's top left make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there are 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the RNG Info section, leave the Initial IV Advances and Max IV\nAdvances both at 0. The Initial Advances you want to\nput to 4 and the Max Advances to 0. This way PokeFinder will\nonly search for targets that are exactly 4 Advances in. This is\nimportant as there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in when you're\nstanding in front of Bianca. Those NPCs will advance the RNG by 4 most\noften before you can take the Starter (if you're as fast as you can be).\nGenerally between 0-12 advances can happen, but 4 is the by far most\ncommon amount, whilst ones further away from it get less and less likely.\n\nNote: Why 4 advances? \nWithout getting too technical, there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in \nwhen taking the Starter from Bianca that can already advance the RNG whilst\nthe game is showing you the current season upon loading in. If you're as \nfast as possible, there will be 40 frames (at 30fps) during which the NPCs\ncan advance, and for the specific NPC types that are loaded there, the odds\nof 4 advances happening are ~31.69% whilst all other advance numbers have \nfar lower odds at about 15% or less. For more technical details, check out \nthis Google Sheet.\n\nThe\ndate range you choose will depend on whether you want the Starter to\njust be shiny or have a few perfect IVs too and whether you care about\nits met date. If you just care for a shiny, possibly with a specific\nNature and Gender, searching through just 1 day (perhaps whatever\nyour \"today\" is when reading this) will give you several possible\ntargets to go for already. If you want some perfect IVs as well,\nyou'll have to either increase the date range or enable more \nKeypresses in your Profile. \nI do NOT\nrecommend trying to find a 4-6IV target Seed this way, as it will\nrequire you to search through several months to probably even years; if\nyou want such high IVs + shiny, best to prepare for that already\nas explained in the TID/SID RNG guide. Since I will just go for a\nshiny with a specific Gender and Nature right now, I put my Max Advances\nto 0 and the date range to just search through the current day as of\nwriting this guide, which is the 21st of August 2025. If you also only\ncare to get a shiny without any specific IVs, you can disable all but\n\"None\", \"1\" and \"2\" Keypresses in your Profile for comfort.\nNext in the Settings section, select the Starters Category\nwith the Starter you wish to RNG and finally in the Filters section\ninput your desired IVs, Gender, Nature and whether you want a shiny or\nnot.\n\nNote: What are Star and Square shinies? \nStar and Square shinies are\nONLY differentiated in Pokémon Sword and Shield specifically by having\ndifferent shiny sparkles when sent out into battle. If you either don't\nplan to transfer this Pokémon at all or intend to transfer it to\nliterally any other game (all of Gens 6, 7 and 9 + BDSP, Legends: Arceus\nand Legends: Z-A), this difference does not exist.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nNow you can hit the Search button. Once PokeFinder has found a\nresult you're happy with, you can cancel the search if it's not done\nalready. If you get no results or none you're satisfied with, you can\neither search through a different date range (e.g. the full current\nmonth), increase the Max Advances or select more possible Keypresses in\nyour Profile.\n\n  \n  \n\nI will pick this marked Naive Male Oshawott Seed here on the 21st of\nAugust 2025 at 21:16:20 because its target second in 20 is the most\ncomfortable one for me to aim for here since I'm playing on a DS Phat\n(same would apply to the DS Lite and DSi; on 3DS going for something\nbetween like 40-55 target seconds would be most comfortable, a fairly\nfast target second matters a bit more for this RNG than it does for\nother RNGs as you'll likely have to do quite a lot of attempts before\ngetting the shiny. \nSo taking a target second that would have you wait\nvery long before even getting into the game will add up over time).\nThere's also 2 Keypresses in the Select button and the Up direction on\nthe D-pad that I'll have to press and hold during startup of the game.\nThe RNG process\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seed's\nseconds (20 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date to\nthe target date (here the 21st of August 2025) and get ready to\nchange and confirm the target time (21:16 for me; should EonTimer say\n\"Minutes Before Target: 1\" and your target time is e.g. 12:30:05,\nyou'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS).\n\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu, get\nready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer\nsounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons your target Seed\nmay require (start pressing the buttons right after you started the\ngame and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will\nneed to press and hold the Select button and the Up direction on the\nD-pad).\n\nNow continue getting into the game. Once you click continue on the\nsave file selection screen, immediately start spamming the A button\nto make the season showing screen fade faster. This is important as the\nrandomly moving NPCs that are loaded in can already start moving, and\nthus advance the RNG, whilst the game is showing you the current season.\nNow keep spamming the A button and take your Starter as quickly as\npossible (as soon as Bianca's textboxes start, the NPCs will no longer\nbe able to move). If you're lucky, you will have the shiny Starter of\nyour dreams now, in which case you can skip to the\n\"Next Steps...\" section.\nTroubleshooting\nIf your Starter did not shine, which is fairly likely in BW2 due to the\nNPCs and inconsistent Timer0, double check all date and time\nsettings match your target, make sure you accounted for any minutes\nbefore target if EonTimer tells you you need them and check if all\nthe buttons you may need to press and hold are working properly.\nIf you found an error, try again with it fixed. If you found nothing or\nit also didn't shine after the fix, which is still fairly likely, you'll\nnow need to figure out whether you're just getting Timer0'd (aka the\ngame did not \"give\" you your most common Timer0 yet) or whether the NPCs\nare interfering with you getting the shiny. To check this, you'll need\nto calculate the IVs of the Starters you get.\n\n  \n  \n\nOpen up the IV calculator, select the generation 5 games and\nselect the Pokémon you're going for.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow after a Starter RNG attempt, input its Nature,\nCharacteristics, Level and Stats and then press the Find\nIVs button; the resulting IV ranges will appear in the bottom right of\nthe IV Calculator.\n\nNote: The Characteristics of your Pokémon are not in PokeFinder? \nFor English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were\nchanged in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for\nthese, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar\nissue, but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's\nCharacteristics change, so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you\nmay have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokémon wiki site of\nthat language for example.\n\n\nNext compare the IVs of the Starter you got with the IVs of\nthe Starter you were aiming for in the searcher tab (ignore the\nNature; it can change depending on how much the NPCs advanced by, whilst\nthe IVs will ALWAYS stay the exact same as long as you hit your target\nSeed. The Characteristics will usually be the same, however if your\ntarget has 2 or more stats that both have the same equally highest IV,\nthe Characteristics can be one of up to 6 different ones, depending on\nhow many of the stats have the same highest IV value; it'll be different\nfrom advance to advance. E.g. if your starter has 31 Attack and 31 Speed,\nit can have either the Attack or the Speed Characteristic for a stat of\n31). To not waste any time, start by comparing the IV that your last\nStarter's Characteristics was linked to, which is always the one with a\nfew specific options that are divided by commas in the IV Calculator's\nresults (in the following image that would be SpAtk with 14, 19, 24 or 29).\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my case, the latest Oshawott had a SpAtk Characteristics that,\ntogether with all the other IV ranges, gave me the information that the\nSpAtk must be either 14, 19, 24 or 29. Since my target Seed's SpAtk IV is\n6, I already know I did not hit my target Seed. So now I will simply\ngo back to the console's date and time settings and start the next\nRNG attempt.\nBut what to do if the IVs matched perfectly?\n\n\n  \n  \n\nOn my 5th attempt I got this Oshawott whose calculated IV ranges match\nthe IVs of my target, so I can assume that I most likely hit my\ntarget Timer0 and with that my target Seed. Since it wasn't shiny,\nthe NPCs did not advance the RNG by 4 this time and if I were to just\ntry again, they would advance the exact same amount again as well\nleading to me never getting the shiny. We can get around this by\nunderstanding how NPC movement works. Their movement is determined by\n2 things: the current RNG state (the Seed and its advances) and their\nlast saved position (if they are already loaded in which they are when\nstanding next to Bianca). \nSince it would be quite annoying to have to\nfind a new Seed every time we run into this problem, we don't wanna\nchange that part. But their last saved position is something we can\neasily influence. To change it, simply get into the game normally\nwithout RNG (you can do with RNG, but it's a waste of time for this),\nstand idly next to Bianca for a few seconds (doesn't matter whether\nyou're in front, left of or right of her; 5-10 seconds is more than\nenough for example) and then save the game.\n\nThis will reposition the NPCs and make it so that next time they\nhave a fairly good chance of advancing the RNG differently than last\nattempt. Repositioning the NPCs this way is only useful whenever you hit\nyour target Seed, which is why we wanna calculate the IVs every attempt.\nKeep on checking the IVs and reposition the NPCs whenever needed until\nyou get your shiny! Should it still not have shined after 30 attempts\nand you do not seem to hit your target Seed much or at all, begin a\nStarter RNG attempt by loading into the game on your target date/time,\nbut instead of getting into the game and taking the Starter, do 1\nProfile Calibration attempt as explained in the Unova Link Needle\nCalibration section of the Profile Calibration guide. \nIf the result of the Profile Calibration attempt matches your target\nsecond (or is very close by; it being 1 too high or low is fairly common\non 3DS models specifically), but has a different Timer0, you seem to be\ngetting Timer0'd (the game mostly gives you your other Timer0s). In\nthat case you can choose between continuing to try as you will get it\neventually (though it may take a while if you continue being unlucky) or\ntrying out a different target Seed for your Starter, as some\ndate/time/Keypress combinations may have your usually less common\nTimer0s be much more common, making this RNG take much longer than\nnormal.\nShould you however get no results at all, join im a blisy ._.'s RNG\nmanip assistance Discord server\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of\nthe issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder Static and\nCalibration windows and EonTimer.\n\nAfter about 17 attempts and repositioning the NPCs 4 times, I got my\nshiny Oshawott!\nNext steps...\nAnd with the Starter successfully RNGd, we can now save the\ngame. And that's it; if you'd like to learn how to RNG some shiny\nLegendaries and other stationaries and gifts in this game, check out the\nStatic guide.\nThank you for reading and have fun RNGing!\n\n","description":"How to Manip a shiny Starter in BW2.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/bw2starter/","title":"BW2 Starter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/calibration/":{"body":"Overview\nCalibrating your game is the mandatory first step for any Gen 5 RNG\nManipulation. Calibrating in this context means finding certain values\nthat are tied to 1 specific combination of game cartridge + a DS console\n(specifically the console's Motherboard and Wi-Fi Board). So if you e.g.\nhave a Pokémon White Version, a Pokémon Black Version, a Pink Nintendo\nDS Lite and a Blue Nintendo 3DS and you calibrate your White Version +\nthe Pink DS Lite, you will have ONLY found the Calibration for that\nspecific cartridge + console combination. If you now wish to RNG with\nyour White Version on the Blue 3DS or with your Black version on either\nof the two DS Consoles, you will need to calibrate those specific\ncombinations as well.\nWith your White Version + Pink DS Lite calibrated, you could RNG a few\nPokémon and then e.g. just continue to play your adventure normally on\nyour Blue 3DS if you wanted to. If you then switch back to the Pink DS\nLite, you will not need to calibrate again as the Calibration does not\nchange. It is also not tied to your savefile in any way so if you delete\nthe savefile you originally calibrated with, the calibration will remain\nexactly the same on any new one.\nThe Process is almost exactly the same no matter what model DS console\nyou're using, however there's some small but important differences\nI'll explain later. The most noteworthy difference is that 3DS and 2DS\nmodel consoles both take longer to boot up DS games AND take an\ninconsistent amount of time, making you miss your targeted time by a second or\ntwo every now and then. If you have a DS, Lite, or i at your disposal, I\nrecommend you do Gen 5 RNG on that. But if you don't have one, using a\n3DS line model will work as well no problem.\n\n  Note: New research regarding 3DS second inconsistency.\n  New research suggests that the reason for the second you hit being so inconsistent on\n3DS models is due to the console not resetting its hidden millisecond\ntimer when the user changes date or time whereas the DS and DSi did\nreset it. In the future timer tools may have a metronome feature or\nsomething similar that may help make it significantly more consistent.\nThough the loading times will still be much longer and therefore you\nwill still often have to wait longer on an RNG attempt before you can\nenter the game compared to playing on a DS, Lite or i.\n\nThis Guide will likely only work for you if you have an original copy\nof a gen 5 game as ROMs played via Twilight Menu or NDS forwarder and\nfake cartridges calculate these values we're trying to figure out in a\ndifferent, largely unknown way, making it much more difficult or often\neven impossible to calibrate.\nIf you are playing using an original cartridge but on a hacked DSi or 3DS,\nI recommend you always remove the SD card before doing any RNG Manipulation,\nas SD cards on hacked consoles, especially larger ones, tend to increase the \ninconsistency. The console will still boot up just fine without it. If\nyou're unsure whether your DSi or 3DS is hacked, turn it off, start\npressing and then hold the A &amp; B buttons on DSi or Select on 3DS and\nthen start the console again. If you now see a menu pop up with a lot\nof text and the words \"Nocash Unlaunch\" (DSi) or \"Luma3DS\" (3DS) in the\ntop left of the top screen, it's hacked. If it just boots into the normal\nhome menu, it's not hacked.\nThe values we're looking to find using this Calibration process are\ncalled the VCount, Timer0, VFrame and GxStat.\nWhilst the VCount, VFrame and GxStat always stay\nconsistent throughout this Calibration process (so you can get only 1\nspecific value for each of those), the Timer0 varies between a\nlimited number of values. Which Timer0 you get exactly is random every\ntime you start the game or soft reset, though for RNG Manip in\nGeneration 5, we want to stay away from soft resetting for now as the\ncurrent RNG programs cannot account for that. How many different\nTimer0's you can get here depends on both the game you're playing and\nthe console you're playing on.\nHere we have the first difference between BW1 and BW2.\nIn Black and White 1, you can always get exactly 2 different,\nnumerically adjacent Timer0 values. If one of your Timer0's is 1110\nfor example, the other Timer0 you can get must either be 110F or 1111.\nThe F can be here because these are hexadecimal numbers, meaning instead\nof counting from 0-9 and then going over to the next 10th, this system\ncounts from 0-9 and then A-F so there's 16 different values possible\ninstead of only 10 going 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F,\n10, 11, [...]. Which of the other two Timer0 values it actually is\nyou may find out during this Calibration process, but even if you don't\nthat's fine, as in that case it would be your lesser common Timer0\nvalue which you generally wouldn't want to use for RNG Manipulation.\nShould both the Timer0 values you find be evenly split in how often you\ngot them, you can either just choose one at random to RNG with in the\nfuture or input both of them into your RNG Profile to use both for RNG\nManipulation; whichever you prefer.\nIn Black and White 2, however, you can get more than just 2 Timer0's\nmaking RNG there more inconsistent than it is in BW1, but in exchange\nBW2 have other advantages such as more varied wild and static encounters\nto choose from and much better methods for advancing the RNG quickly.\nFrom my experience I've found that there's 3 different ways the Timer0\ncan be distributed for a given console+cartridge combination in BW2:\n\n\nThe standard distribution:\nHere you'll have between ~6-8 Timer0's, 1-2 of which are a fair bit\nmore common than the rest. This one is by far the most common and it\nis the only Timer0 distribution you can get if you're playing on a DS\nor DS Lite, though it is also most common on DSi and 3DS models.\n\n\nThe lucky distribution:\nWith this one you'll only hit 1 or 2 specific Timer0's about 90% of the\ntime, making hitting the Timer0 you are aiming for almost as quick as it\nis in BW1. This distribution can ONLY exist on DSi and 3DS and is\npretty rare.\n\n\nThe unlucky distribution:\nThis is by far the worst one, as you can get between ~10-20 or possibly\neven more different Timer0's, none of which are particularly more common\nthan the rest. If this is the Timer0 distribution you got, RNG\nManipulation will be VERY annoying and honestly I wouldn't torture\nmyself with that. If you have ANY other console than the one you got\nthis unlucky distribution with, even if it is the exact same model, I\nstill recommend to try Calibration on that one as well, as there's a\nchance you will get a standard or maybe even lucky Timer0 distribution\nthere. This distribution can also ONLY exist on DSi and 3DS and is\npretty rare too.\n\n\nThis is still a fairly recent discovery and I'm sure we don't know\neverything about this that there is to know yet, but for now this is\nwhat to expect when Calibrating BW2 on a DSi or 3DS.\nRecommended setup\nHardware requirements\n\n\nPokémon Black, White, Black 2 or White 2 in ANY language\n\n\na Nintendo DS line console (DS, DS Lite, DSi, DSi XL, 3DS, 3DS XL,\n2DS, New 3DS, New 3DS XL, New 2DS XL)\n\n\na Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nor QT 6.8 or newer\n\n\nIn-Game requirements\n\nCurrently have any savefile on your cartridge (for BW2 the Unova\nLink option does appear without a savefile, but is not usable for\nCalibration without one).

For some languages, UI elements are also translated (e.g.\nin German and Italian), but not for all (e.g. Japanese and Korean don't have\nfull UI translation).\n\n\nFor Windows: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.6-calibration-fix\n\n\nFor Mac &amp; Linux: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.4\n\n\nVideo example\n\nKronos\n\nThe Guide\nEonTimer setup\nEonTimer will use the exact same setup for both BW1 and BW2.\nIf you're using a DS, DS Lite or DSi, set the target\nsecond to 20 and the calibration to -95, and if you're wanting to\ncalibrate on a (New) 3DS (XL) or (New) 2DS (XL), set the target\nsecond to 40 and the calibration to -424 (if your DSi is hacked\nand has a very large SD card with 128 or more GB, you may need to put\nthe Target Second to 25 instead of the base 20 and adjust all second\nrelated numbers later by adding +5 to them. Same goes for the 3DS, but\nyou should put the target second to 45 instead of the base 40. If you\nremove the SD card before trying to RNG, this is not required).\n\nDS(i)\n \n \n3DS\n \n \n\nWhich target second you pick generally doesn't matter, however I've\nchosen 20 and 40 respectively so you will (almost) always have enough\ntime to get back to the home menu after changing your ds console's time,\nbut also don't have to wait unnecessarily long. The Calibration is more\nimportant to be at the recommended values here, however they won't work\nperfectly for everyone and I'll explain later how to adjust it for\nyourself if needed.\nAlso make sure that “Precision Calibration” is turned off in the\nsettings under the “Timer” tab.\n\nPick a method to use\nIf you're playing BW1, select the Save Needle Calibration Tab and if\nyou're playing BW2, select the Unova Link Needle Calibration Tab. IV\nCalibration is a Plan B &amp; works for both BW1 &amp; BW2. You can try it if\nthe first method you tried yielded no results for you.\n\n  Save Needle\n  Unova Link Needle\n  IV Calibration\n\nSetup\n\nThis method can be used in both BW1 and BW2, but if you are playing\nBW2, go to the Unova Link Needle Calibration Tab to not waste your\nown time. There are also some BW2 exclusive specifications that I will\nnot mention in this Save Needle Calibration tab, but only in the Unova\nLink Needle Calibration and IV Calibration tabs.\nI will be using my German White 1 game together with my Nintendo 3DS\nconsole for this example.\nBefore you start you need to move your player character to a\nsilent location that doesn't have anything that can advance the RNG on\nits own, then save the game. Your character's home room is\nrecommended here as it's the first accessible location when starting a\nnew savefile.\n\nYou also have to make sure that Tornadus or Thundurus are NOT actively\nroaming throughout the Unova region in your game as that will advance\nthe RNG whenever you boot up the game by a bit and make Save Needle\nCalibration impossible.\nIf you're far enough into the game to activate the roamer, which is\nafter the 7th gym, and are unsure whether your Tornadus or Thundurus is\ncurrently roaming, you can check a gate's electronic bulletin board for\nnews about a storm (GIF displays Thundurus' message; Tornadus is a bit\ndifferent).\n\nIf it is indeed roaming, it would be fastest to just encounter and kill\nit; it'll respawn after you beat the champion again. Should you for some\nreason not be willing to kill or capture it, you'll have to use the IV\ncalibration method. It is unaffected by the roamer and will allow you to\nsuccessfully calibrate.\nTo start the Save Needle Calibration, you open up PokéFinder, go to\nGen 5 Tools at the top and open up the Profile Calibrator.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the left half of the window, switch over to the Needle Search\ntab, select the Saving option and input the date and time you\nwish to use for this. I'll just put it to the 23rd of May 2025, 15:00\n(aka 3pm) because that's the current date and time whilst I'm writing\nthis guide.\nThen in the right half you start by selecting the game version,\nlanguage, console you play on and add your console's MAC\naddress which can be found in the internet settings.\nOn DS and DS Lite you need to access it from within the game's menu and\non DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard Wi-Fi\nsettings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS/2DS).\nIf your MAC address starts with one or multiple 0's, those will\nautomatically be omitted by PokéFinder (e.g. a MAC address like\n00-08-53-30-64-90 would become 853306490).\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the seconds Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -5 and\n+5. So if you're on 3DS line models and used my recommended seconds,\nput it to Min 35 and Max 45 and on DS, Lite or i to Min 15 and Max\n25.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverything else you'll want to leave as it is by default (if you\naccidentally change something else, you can always just change game\nversion and then change back to reset to the default values).\nThe Soft Reset checkbox is currently not working\nproperly, so don't use it.\n\n\nThis method is exclusive to BW2 and much faster than the other two\nmethods. Similarly to the Save Needle method, the Unova Link Needle\nCalibration also makes use of the little clock symbol, but this time\nwhen you're trying to establish an Infrared link between your current\nBW2 game and another BW2 game using Unova Link. You don't need to\nactually have another BW2 game for this, as simply starting the search\nis all we need to do.\nI will be using my English Black 2 game together with my Nintendo DS\nconsole for this example.\nTo start the Unova Link Needle Calibration, you open up PokéFinder,\ngo to Gen 5 Tools at the top and open up the Profile Calibrator.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the left half of the window, switch over to the Needle Search\ntab, make sure the Unova Link option is selected and input the\ndate and time you wish to use for this. I'll just put it to the 23rd\nof May 2025, 15:00 (aka 3pm) because that's the current date and time\nwhilst I'm writing this guide.\nThen in the right half you start by selecting the game version,\nlanguage, console you play on and add your console's MAC\naddress which can be found in the internet settings of your console.\nOn DS and DS Lite you need to access it from within the game's menu and\non DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard Wi-Fi\nsettings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS). If\nyour MAC address starts with one or multiple 0's, those will\nautomatically be omitted by PokéFinder (e.g. a MAC address like\n00-08-53-30-64-90 would become 853306490).\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso check the Memory Link checkbox if you have activated Memory\nLink on this current savefile.\nThis can, of course, only be the case on pre-existing savefiles, so if\nyou just created a new one, you don't check the box. But if it is indeed\nan older savefile you'll want to check whether Memory Link has been\nactivated or not by going to the Unova Link menu, then to the Memory\nLink option and once there checking if the option „Memory List\" is\nthere. If it is, Memory Link is guaranteed active and you need to check\noff the box for it, but if it isn't, that doesn't necessarily mean that\nMemory Link was not used yet.\n\nI tested this myself and you can already do Memory Link with a Black or\nWhite 1 game that hasn't even received the starter yet as long as the\ngame has any savefile present at all, even if it's got under a minute of\nplaytime. If Memory Link was used with such an early savefile, there is\nno way I know of to tell it was used on the BW2 game's side, as the\nMemory List option does not appear. So should you not find any valid\nseeming results during Calibration of an older BW2 savefile without the\nMemory Link box checked off, try with it. My Black 2 has done Memory\nLink so I will check off the box.\nPut the seconds Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -5 and\n+5. So if you're on DS, Lite or i and used my recommended seconds,\nput it to Min 15 and Max 25 and on 3DS line models to Min 35 and\nMax 45.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverything else you'll want to leave as it is by default (if you\naccidentally change something else, you can always just change game\nversion from BW1 to BW2 and then back or vice versa to reset to the\ndefault values).\nThe Soft Reset checkbox is currently not working\nproperly, so don't use it.\n\n\nThis method can be used in both BW1 and BW2 but is slower than the\nother methods, especially for BW2. Here you catch a Pokémon and then\ncalculate its IVs to find your Calibration values. To make the IV\ncalculation easier, you should be saved in an area with as high as\npossible level wild Pokémon. In BW1 I recommend the dark (not regular)\ngrass in the crater within Giant Chasm and in BW2 I recommend the dark\ngrass on Route 1.\n\nThere are also additional things you should prepare that the other two\ncalibration methods do not need:\n\n\nA Pokémon with Sweet Scent or at least 1 Honey item (can be\nobtained via the Honey Gather ability from Combee, which can be found\nin the grass on Route 12 in BW1 and BW2. Alternatively you can buy it\nin BW2's Join Avenue Market Shops that are level 2 or higher)\n\n\nPokeballs to capture Pokémon (Masterball preferred)\n\n\nAn empty slot in your party (optional, but helpful)\n\n\nA few Rare Candies (optional, but having 2-3 is helpful)\n\n\n\n Note: Why are Rare Candies useful? \nIf during IV Calibration you get 2 or\nmore different results, you will need to level up your Pokémon to get a\nmore precise IV range from the IV calculator. If you do this via\nbattling against other Pokémon and gaining EXP, your Pokémon will also\ngain EVs which can increase stats and make the IV calculator's results\ninaccurate. Using Rare Candies on the other hand does not give your\nPokémon any EVs, making them very useful for IV calculation.\n\nI will be using my English Black 2 game together with my capture card\nNintendo DS console for this example so I can take high quality pictures\nof what's happening in-game.\nTo start the IV Calibration, you open up PokéFinder, go to Gen 5\nTools at the top and open up the Profile Calibrator.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the left half of the window, make sure the IV tab is selected and\ninput the date and time you wish to use for this. I'll just put it\nto the 23rd of May 2025, 15:00 (aka 3pm) because that's the current date\nand time whilst I'm writing this guide.\nThen in the right half you start by selecting the game version,\nlanguage, console you play on and add your console's MAC\naddress which can be found in the internet settings of your console.\nOn DS and DS Lite you need to access it from within the game's menu and\non DSi or 3DS models you can view it in your console's standard Wi-Fi\nsettings (top left is DS/Lite, top right is DSi and bottom is 3DS).

But if it is\nindeed an older savefile you'll want to check whether Memory Link has\nbeen activated or not by going to the Unova Link menu, then to the\nMemory Link option and once there checking if the option „Memory List\"\nis there.

Next you\ngo to the time settings and change the time according to the calibration\nwindow as well, but at the same moment that you confirm the time\nchange, you start EonTimer by clicking the Start button.\n\nDS\n \n \nDSi\n \n\n \n3DS\n \n \n\n\nNow you go back to the home menu (on DSi and 3DS line models you can\neither navigate back through the settings or use the Power Button to get\nback whilst on DS and Lite you have to shut off the console and turn it\nback on after).\n\nDS\n \n \nDSi\n \n\n \n3DS\n \n \n\nOnce there you wait for the timer to run out and on the 6th and final\nbeep of EonTimer you start the game. Make sure not to press any\nbuttons in between you starting the game and the star appearing on the\ntop screen, since that will change the Seed you're on and just add an\nunnecessary extra step to this.\n\nOnce you see this star, you may start pressing buttons and get into the\ngame. If you're far enough into the story to have received the\nC-Gear, you must deactivate it upon entering the game as it\nwould otherwise advance the RNG and make Calibration impossible.\nWith this being the Save Needle Calibration method, we will make use of\nthe clock symbol that appears whenever you save the game; the position\nthe clock's hand starts at when saving is what you need to pay attention\nto.\nHere's a GIF of the first needle I got during this Calibration followed\nby a picture of the starting position:\n\n\nAs you can see, the first needle starting position I got is a bottom\nleft ↙ needle, which I add into PokéFinder's Calibration window by\nclicking on the bottom left needle button.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow we continue on saving the game again until we have the starting\nposition of 8 needles in a row. If you didn't see one of the needles\nstarting positions, you cannot continue and have to go back to the home\nmenu to try again, beginning with changing the time back and starting\nEonTimer.\nOnce you are done with the 8 needles, press the Search button and\nsee what result PokéFinder gives you.\nIn my case I got the following result:\n\n  \n  \n\nThere's a few things to watch out for here:\n\n\nIf your results Seconds value does not match your EonTimer's target\nsecond, make sure it's not too far off. On DS, Lite and i, the\nsecond should never be off by more than 2. Being off by 1 is already\nrare and being off by 2 near impossible but both have happened to\npeople in the past. On 3DS line models being off by 1 or 2 is fairly\ncommon due to the console having an inconsistent boot-up time for DS\ngames. Being off by 3 may also be possible in rare cases, but if you\nget a result that's 4 or more seconds off, it's most likely an\ninvalid result.\n\n\nShould you get more than 1 result you can simply add a 9th needle\nand press Search again and if that still isn't enough to narrow\nit down to 1, add a 10th etc until you're at exactly 1 result.\n\n\nIf you get no results at all or only get results that are too far\noff from your target second, make sure all the values in your\nPokéFinder and EonTimer are correct and match what's on your DS\nconsole (date, time, MAC address, game version, language, DS type,\nsaving option selected and EonTimer calibration). Then just do\nanother attempt. Should you get 0 results again, join im a blisy\n._.'s RNG manip assistance Discord server\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation\nof the issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder\nCalibration window and EonTimer.\n\n\nThe result I got here looks good though, as it's the only one and the\nsecond I hit is 2 off from my target which is normal on 3DS. In the\nfuture however when we get to actually RNGing e.g. a shiny Pokémon, we\nwill need to hit the exact target second and not 1-2 seconds late or\nearly. For this we need to adjust EonTimer so that, in my example, I can\nhopefully hit the 40 seconds next attempt. To adjust EonTimer you simply\ntake the second you hit instead of your target (42 for me instead of\n40), put it into the Second Hit field and press the Update\nbutton.\n\nThis will change your Calibration value so that next time you'll be\nmore likely to hit your actual target second.\nAfter this first attempt we will now write down the values we got\nsomewhere (e.g. a standard text file):\n\n\n\nThat finishes the PokéFinder setup; now you can start the first\ncalibration attempt.\nFor that you go to your console's settings and change the date to match\nwhichever date you put into the PokéFinder Calibration window.

Navigate\nto the UNOVA LINK menu, go to KEY SYSTEM and then select SEND\nAND RECEIVE KEYS.\n\nWith this being the Unova Link Needle Calibration method, we will make\nuse of the clock symbol that appears whenever you have the game try to\nestablish an infrared link to another BW2 game to send or receive keys;\nthe position the clock's hand starts at when activating the IR search is\nwhat you need to pay attention to. How long you have the search active\nfor doesn't matter. You could cancel it immediately or have it go on for\na minute straight; makes no difference for the calibration.\nHere's a GIF of the first needle I got during this Calibration followed\nby a picture of the starting position:\n\n\nAs you can see, the first needle starting position I got is a right\nfacing → needle, which I add into PokéFinder's Calibration window by\nclicking on the bottom left needle button.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow we continue on restarting the infrared connection via SEND AND\nRECEIVE KEYS until we have the starting position of 8 needles in a\nrow.

An example would be if I had hit 19 seconds instead of 20 I\nwould input 19 into the Second Hit field and press Update which\nwould change my EonTimer Calibration value from -95 to -66.\n\nI won't be changing this for my next attempt though, since I hit exactly\nwhat I was aiming for.\nAfter this first attempt we will now write down the values we got\nsomewhere (e.g. a standard text file):\n\n\n\nThat finishes the PokéFinder setup; now you can start the first\ncalibration attempt.\nFor that you go to your console's settings and change the date to match\nwhichever date you put into the PokéFinder Calibration window.

If you're far enough into the story to have received the\nC-Gear, you must deactivate it upon entering the game as it\nwould otherwise advance the RNG and make Calibration impossible.\nIn-game you will want to go into your party menu/bag and use Sweet\nScent as a field move/Honey from the bag to summon a wild Pokémon.\n\nIt doesn't matter how quickly or slowly you do this, just make sure to\nnot move your player character as that can advance the IVrng and thus\nscrew up this Calibration attempt. If you are doing this in the dark\ngrass as I recommended, you may end up getting a double battle against 2\nwild Pokémon. In that case you will need to kill the Pokémon on the left\nand catch the Pokémon on the right side of the field (preferably using a\nMaster Ball so you don't have to waste time with failed catches).\nWith the first caught Pokémon in our party, we open up the IV calculator\nin PokéFinder.\n\n  \n  \n\nOnce there, input the game you're playing, the Pokémon, its\ncharacteristic &amp; nature and at the bottom its level and\nstats.\n\nNote: The Characteristics of your Pokémon are not in PokeFinder? \nFor English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were\nchanged in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for\nthese, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar\nissue, but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's\nCharacteristics change, so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you\nmay have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokémon wiki site of\nthat language for example.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nOnce all the data is in the fields, you can press the Find IVs\nbutton and it'll spit out the calculated IVs in the bottom right.\n\n  \n  \n\nShould any of the results say Invalid instead of a number or number\nrange, you input something wrongly. Double check all data is correct and\nwithout typos.\nPressing Find IVs will also automatically send the results over to\nthe Calibration window which means all we have to do now is press the\nSearch button and see what result PokéFinder gives us.\nIn my case I got the following result:\n\n  \n  \n\nThere's a few things to watch out for here:\n\n\nIf your results Seconds value does not match your EonTimer's target\nsecond, make sure it's not too far off.

An example would be if I had hit 19 seconds instead of 20 I\nwould input 19 into the Second Hit field and press Update which\nwould change my EonTimer Calibration value from -95 to -66.\n\nI won't be changing this for my next attempt though, since I hit exactly\nwhat I was aiming for.\nAfter this first attempt we will now write down the values we got\nsomewhere (e.g. a standard text file):\n\n\nFurther attempts\n\nNow with the first attempt done you go back to the home menu and\nget ready to change the time and start up EonTimer again.\nYou'll want to do between 4-9 more such calibrations for a total\nof 5-10 attempts to find what your most common Timer0 value\nis.\nThis is important because later when you're trying to RNG e.g. a\nshiny, you will want the highest chances of hitting your target Timer0.\nIf you were to only do 1 single Calibration for example, you may have\njust had bad luck and hit a Timer0 that, on average, you'd only get\nabout 10% of the time, which also means you'd miss your target about 90%\nof the time. Some date/time combinations may have one Timer0 be much\nmore common than it would be on most other date/time combinations. To\nprevent this from giving you a \"bad\" Timer0, that on most other date/time\ncombinations you would barely ever hit, I recommend to change the\ntarget time just a little bit after every Calibration attempt. In my\nexample I'll just put the clock in both PokéFinder and on my DS console\nforward by 1 minute each attempt so on attempt 2 I will target\n15:01/3:01 pm, on attempt 3 15:02/3:02 pm and so on.\n\n  \n  \n\nIf even after adjusting EonTimer you still keep hitting 1-2 above or\nbelow your target second most of the time, don't keep adjusting every\nsingle attempt. Instead write down which second you hit every time, and\nthen at the end of the 5-10 attempts, take the average, round it up/down\nand then use that average second hit to adjust your EonTimer. Especially\non 3DS models you will most likely continue to not always hit your\ntarget second due to the varying loading times of those models.\n\n\nNow with the first attempt done you go back to the home menu and\nget ready to change the time and start up EonTimer again.\nYou'll want to do between 19-29 more such calibrations for a total\nof 20-30 attempts to find what your most common Timer0 value\nis on DS and DS Lite or 29-39 for a total of 30-40 more on DSi and\n3DS.\nThis is important because later when you're trying to RNG e.g. a\nshiny, you will want the highest chances of hitting your target Timer0.\nIf you were to only do 10 calibrations for example, you may have just had\nbad luck and like 7 times hit a Timer0 that, on average, you'd only get\nabout 10% of the time, which also means you'd miss your target about 90%\nof the time. Some date/time combinations may have one Timer0 be much\nmore common than it would be on most other date/time combinations.

Whilst I\ndid say earlier that this value stays consistent throughout your\ncalibration, this isn't always true. In rare cases, you may get 2\ndifferent VCount values that are tied to some of your Timer0's.\nThis has been reported with VCounts of AB &amp; AC, AC &amp; AD, BD &amp; BE and\n82 &amp; 83 as of yet though I am sure there's more possible cases.\nIt seems to be most common on DSi or 3DS, however the report\nwith VCounts of 82 &amp; 83 was from a DS Lite user so even if you’re\nplaying on a DS or Lite, watch out for this (though getting one of\nthe mentioned VCounts doesn't necessarily mean that you are affected\nby this). If this is the case for you, make sure to note down which\nTimer0 has which VCount assigned to it, as each Timer0 can only have\n1 specific VCount value go with it. This will generally not impact\nyour ability to RNG Manipulate, but it will make troubleshooting\nwhen something goes wrong a bit more annoying later.\nExample of how such a Timer0 distribution with 2 VCounts could look like\nafter 30 Calibration attempts:\n\nIf even after adjusting EonTimer you still keep hitting 1-2 above or\nbelow your target second most of the time, don't keep adjusting every\nsingle attempt.

This\nisn't mandatory, but pressing 6, 7 or 8 different buttons on your DS\nduring startup is sometimes not humanly possible and you should be able\nto find target Seeds without too many advances for almost anything you'd\nwant anyways without those high Keypress amounts. Unchecking those 3\nKeypress options will also shorten search times later. You could also\nremove more, like 4 and 5, but I find those still feasible and having\nmore Keypresses will make finding e.g. 5/6IV wild or static shiny targets\neasier later (if you just care for getting shinies and don't care for\nIVs or Natures at all, you can disable all but 0 Keypresses).\nThe Skip L/R checkbox is for if your console's L or R buttons are\nbroken, as if that box is checked off, PokéFinder will no longer give\nany results with L or R as the required Keypresses.\nThe IV Cache and SHA Cache you can ignore for now; more on those in future\nstatic and wild RNG guides.\nFinally click on Accept and the Profile is saved.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nAt the end of my 30 calibrations, my Timer0 distribution looked like\nthis:\n\nI hit 1104 9 times making it my most common Timer0.

To get your TID and\nSID, you should go to the TID/SID RNG guide next. This is\nonly required for getting shinies, so if you only care to get perfect IV Pokémon\nthat are not shiny, you can skip that guide and go directly into the Static\nor Wild (coming soon™) Manip guides.\nThank you for reading and have fun RNGing!\n\n\n","description":"How to find your Timer0 for BW1 & BW2 RNG Manipulation.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/calibration/","title":"BW/BW2 Calibration"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/introduction/":{"body":"BW/BW2 RNG Manip Introduction\nGeneration 5 is one of the easiest Generations to RNG Manipulate in.\nThis is due to how Gen 5 determines the initial seed which decides\neverything random that happens in the game such as which Pokemon you\nencounter, what IVs and nature it has and whether it is shiny or not.\nThe initial seed is a 64 bit hexadecimal number (so a 16 digit long hex\nnumber e.g. 6A513E0B204DA507) that is determined when you boot up your\nGen 5 game by a combination of the date and time your console is set to\ndown to the second, any buttons that are being pressed whilst the game\nis starting up, your consoles MAC address and 4 additional values called\nthe \"VCount\", \"Timer0\", \"GxStat\" and \"Vframe\".\nThis may sound like a lot on first glance, and I agree that Gen 5 RNG is\na bit more complex to get into at first compared to Generations 3 or 4\nfor example, however once you've set everything up and done your first\nGen 5 RNG, most others after will be pretty quick and easy, as Gen 5 only\nhas very few difficult RNGs.\nIn all prior and future Generations you have to hit at least one,\nsometimes multiple, fairly precise timing windows of 1/30th or 1/60th of\na second at some point during most RNG methods, however Gen 5 only has\nthe full second you need to hit for your target seed, which is 30-60\ntimes larger of a time window, making it SIGNIFICANTLY easier.\nOn top of that Gen 5 introduced over 150 new Pokemon, which, combined with\nall the old Pokemon available within Gen 5 and those you can transfer up\nfrom prior Gens and breed, makes it so you can RNG manipulate 622 out of\nthe 649 Pokemon that were available up until Gen 51.\nThe only Generation that rivals Gen 5 in this regard would be Gen 7,\nhowever Gen 5 RNG is easier and faster than Gen 7 RNG.\nPersonally I can do a quick BW1 RNG within 10 minutes and 75% of that is\njust finding a good initial seed to target and setting up the program.\nWith RNG Manip I've for example gotten all the Gift and Stationary\nPokemon that you can get in my German White 2 as shinies with 5 or 6\nperfect IVs (excluding the select few shiny locked encounters such as\nReshiram or the Gift Eevee which just have 5 or 6 Perfect IVs).\n\nI've also been working on a shiny national living dex in my White 2 (am\nabout halfway done as of May 2025) but that project is currently on hold\nsince I'm prioritizing other things such as making guides.\nThese guides will teach you how to RNG Manipulate in Gen 5, so you too can get\nyour favorite shinies or perfect competitive Pokemon quickly and without any\nglitches or hacking.\nIf you're ready, start with the BW/BW2 Calibration Guide, as Calibration\nis a MANDATORY requirement for any Gen 5 RNG.\n\n1\nmissing Pokemon, excluding limited time Events (that you can not\nbreed), are Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo, Mew, Unown, Raikou, Entei,\nSuicune, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Celebi, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Jirachi,\nDeoxys, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Darkrai, Shaymin, Arceus, Victini,\nKeldeo, Meloetta and Genesect.\n\n\nOut of these Lugia, Ho-Oh, Dialga, Palkia and Giratina can be obtained\nand RNG'd via the 3DS eShop exclusive game Pokemon Dream Radar (shiny\nlocked however).\n","description":"What RNG Manips in Unova are all about!","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/introduction/","title":"Gen 5 RNG Manip Introduction"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/static/":{"body":"Overview\nThis Guide will teach you how to RNG manipulate Static Encounters in \nPokémon Black, White, Black 2 and White 2 to get them as shiny, with perfect\nIVs or both combined. To be able to RNG manipulate anything in these games, \nyou need to have done Profile Calibration \nalready. If you wish to get a shiny this way, you will also need to know \nyour Trainer ID and Secret ID. I will use my English\ncopy of Pokémon Black 2 for this guide, though the process is the same\nacross all languages.\nStatic Encounters are divided into 3 different subcategories of encounter \ntypes in Stationaries, Gifts and Roamers.\nStationary encounters are all those that you need to press a button for to \nstart a battle with them such as Cobalion or Kyurem. For most of these you \njust stand in front of the Pokémon and press the A button to start the \nbattle. In PokeFinder’s Static window this includes the “Stationary”, \n“Legends” and “Events” categories (Events being for BW1 only; also not to \nbe confused with the Events tab in PokeFinder's main menu; that one is for \nMystery Gifts which work differently compared to Statics).\nGift encounters are all those that you get given to you without having \nto battle them such as the Fossils or the Magikarp that you can buy for \n500 Pokédollars from the salesman on Marvelous Bridge. In PokeFinder’s \nStatic window this includes the “Starters”, “Fossils”, “Gifts”, \"Curtis\" and\n\"Yancy\" categories (Curtis and Yancy being BW2 exclusive), though we have\nseparate guides for BW1 Starter RNG \nand BW2 Starter RNG, as that early on in your \nadventure you lack most of the tools that we’ll use later on in this guide.\nDue to that, they will not be mentioned again here despite technically\nbeing Gift encounters.\nAdditionally, unlike all other Pokémon you get given as Gifts in these \ngames, the Zorua you get from Rood of the Seven Sages in BW2's Driftveil \nCity cannot be RNGd, as everything about it is set and always the same \n(same IVs, Nature, gender and never shiny).\nFinally there’s the Roamers, which in Gen 5 includes only Tornadus and Thundurus \nin BW1. Roamer RNG is VERY different and can be far more complex compared to \nStationary or Gift RNG so there will be a separate guide for that in the future.\nStationary and Gift RNG are largely the same, which is why they’re both part of \nthis guide instead of having 2 separate ones. The primary difference is that \nStationaries you have to battle and catch yourself whilst Gifts are just given \nto you. They also generate a bit differently via the RNG algorithm so whilst \nyou could e.g. use the exact same target Seed to get yourself a shiny Cobalion, \nVirizion and Terrakion, you cannot use that same Seed to get a shiny Magikarp \nfrom the Bridge salesman as it is a Gift encounter (most often; in some cases \nit may work out fine but don't expect it to always work).\nRecommended setup\nHardware requirements\n\n\nA Gen 5 Pokémon game and any model DS Console you have calibrated \nfor Gen 5 RNG Manipulation.\n\n\na Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nor QT 6.8 or newer\n\n\nIn-Game requirements\n\n\nBe saved in front of the Pokémon or the NPC that gives you the Pokémon \nthat you wish to RNG manipulate facing that Pokémon/NPC\n\n\n\nIf your target is a Stationary encounter, not a Gift, make sure the\nPokémon in the first slot of your party does not have any of the\nfollowing abilities:\nArena Trap, Compound Eyes, Cute Charm, Illuminate, No Guard, Quick Feet,\nStench, Sticky Hold, Suction Cups, Synchronize or White Smoke.\nThese abilities all affect how Stationary encounters generate and can\nthrow off your RNG. A Synchronize lead specifically may be beneficial\nlater, but we'll get to that if needed. \n\n\nThe following are not mandatory, but will make this a lot easier and faster:\n\n\nHave a free slot in your party to quicker confirm whether you hit\nyour target or not later, instead of having to run to a Pokémon Center.\n\n\nIf you’re going for a Stationary encounter, have a Master Ball in your \nbag. This will make checking what you hit whenever it’s not shiny \nsignificantly faster.\nAlso check whether or not you have enough of whatever Poké Ball type\nyou want to later catch the Pokémon in, and possibly have a sleep\ninducing move and false swipe on a Pokémon in your party.\n\n\nHaving a few Rare Candies can also be helpful for figuring out\nwhat's wrong if you cannot seem to get the shiny.\n\n\nIf your goal is to get a shiny with specific IVs and Nature, have at \nleast 1, but preferably 2 Chatot in your party that you recorded a \ncustom Chatter sound onto. This does NOT matter if you just want a\nquick shiny with random IVs.\n\n\n\n  Note: How to get and prepare Chatot for RNG Manipulation \nYou can get Chatot via e.g. catching some in the Route 18 Hidden Grotto \nif you’re playing BW2, by trading online or \nby importing them into your Entree Forest using the program \nEntralinked \n(the latter will only be legal for BW1 players as Chatot was not available\nfor BW2 games via the Dreamworld).\nNot having Chatot will either severely restrict the Pokémon you can go \nfor or make the RNG very inconsistent and tedious; but it is still \npossible. I do not recommend to go for shiny + IVs without Chatot, but \nif you must, there will be an explanation of how to advance the RNG forward\nusing saving the game instead of Chatot later on in the \"The RNG Process\" \nsection.\nYou will also have to use Chatter as a field move and then record a custom\nsound onto it (Chatot learns Chatter at level 21).\nI recommend you try to either shout AAAAAAAAAAA into the DS microphone in\nas monotone, medium pitched and medium volume of a voice as you can muster\nor, what I personally don't like as much but is used by quite a few people,\nplay the sound of this\nYoutube Video\ninto your DS mic.\nThe Chatter will be shared by all your Chatot, so if you\ntry to record a Chatter for another Chatot it'll simply overwrite your first\nChatter. Whenever you deposit the last Chatot from your party into your\nboxes, the Chatter recording is deleted.\nHaving a clear Chatter will be important later for tracking the current\nRNG state.\n\n\nA Pokémon with the ability Synchronize and the Nature you want the target\nPokémon to have. ONLY useful if you're going for specific IVs and shiny at\nthe same time, not only shiny or only IVs.\n\nTools used\n\n\nPokéFinder version 4.3.1 or newer\nPro tip: You can change the language of PokeFinder under \"Tools\" -&gt; \"Settings\"\nto fit your game's language. This will change the names of the Pokémon,\nlocations, Characteristics and Natures to be that of the game's language, which\nmay be helpful later. For some languages, UI elements are also translated (e.g.\nin German and Italian), but not for all (e.g. Japanese and Korean don't have\nfull UI translation).\n\n\nFor Windows: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.6-calibration-fix\n\n\nFor Mac &amp; Linux: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.4\n\n\nVideo example\n\nNone yet\n\nThe Guide\nUnderstanding the mechanics of Gen 5 RNG\nTo determine everything random that happens in Gen 5, the games\ngenerate what we call the \"Initial Seed\" when booting them up from the\nhome menu. The initial Seed is a 64-bit hexadecimal number (so a 16-digit \nlong hex number e.g. 6A513E0B204DA507) that is determined by a combination \nof the DS console's current date &amp; time down to the second, the consoles MAC \naddress, any buttons that are being held down whilst the game is starting up \nand the VCount, Timer0, GxStat and VFrame values you already found during\ncalibration.\nOn this Initial Seed there are what we call \"RNG Advances\" or just \"Advances\"\n(in some older guides also called \"Frames\" though that's a rather inaccurate\nword to describe them) and they contain the information for what randomized\nactions should happen when the RNG is currently on the respective Advance \n(e.g. whether a Pokémon you encounter on an Advance is shiny or not).\n\n  \n  \n\nIn many other Generations, such as Gens 3, 6 or 7, the Advances constantly \nmove from one to the next at varying speeds, though generally close to 60\nAdvances per second. In Gen 5 however (and Gen 4), the RNG only moves \nforward whenever something random actually needs to happen. This makes \nmanipulating the current \"RNG state\" (so what Advance we're on) fairly easy\nas we have a lot of control over it.\nGeneration 5 uses 2 completely separate RNG algorithms derived from the Initial\nSeed to each decide some of the random things that happen in the game:\nThe first of the two, commonly referred to as the PIDrng, controls\nthe \"regular\" Advances. These Advances decide a wild Pokémon's encounter \nslot (so which species of the on a Route available ones you'll battle when \nwalking through grass), its Nature, ability, gender, PID (which decides shininess) \nand whether it's holding an item or not.\nThis PIDrng algorithm is also used by several other things in the game to \ndetermine their random patterns, which also means it is advanced whenever \nthose need to perform a randomized action. Notably this includes \nthe movement of randomly moving NPCs, Rain/Snow/Hail/Sandstorm \npatterns, the game deciding whether you should trigger a wild encounter \nwhen walking through Tall Grass (/Caveground/Surfing on water etc.), what\nposition the clock's needle should start in when saving the game and \nhow high of a pitch a custom recorded Chatter should have each time you \nview the summary of a Chatot (among many other more minor things).\n\n  \n  \n\nThe second RNG algorithm, commonly referred to as the IVrng, is used\nfor far fewer things however. It mainly controls what IVs (and with that\nthe Hidden Power type and base power, since that's fully dependent on IVs) \na Pokémon you encounter will have. It also controls the friendship step \ncounter, which activates every 128 steps and has a 50/50 chance to \nincrease each party member's friendship by 1, whether a Pokémon gets \nPokerus after a battle and ALL the randomized actions inside a battle, \nincluding whether a Focus Blast hits or misses or whether a Flamethrower \ngets a burn on the opposing Pokémon. Due to it controlling all random \nactions in battles, it was made to advance at 60 Advances per second \nfor each Pokémon active on the field to make it harder to manipulate \nthe luck in battles.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe two RNG algorithms being separate also means that, whilst one of the \ntwo can move by hundreds or even thousands of Advances, the other can \nremain at the exact same Advance throughout it all, which is why in these\npictures you see the parts controlled by the PIDrng changing with each\nAdvance, whilst the parts controlled by the IVrng remain the exact same.\nDue to the lack of good and reliable tools for advancing the IVrng, you\nwill later see us always searching for an IVrng Advance of 0 and only ever\nadjusting the PIDrng Advances since those can easily be advanced via e.g.\nChatot.\nAs a side note, the C-Gear is a bit of an odd case here, as it Advances\nboth the PIDrng AND the IVrng whenever it's active. Make sure to always\ndeactivate it when prompted upon loading your save file whilst doing\nRNG Manipulation.\nPick your target Pokémon\nOf course you have to know what Pokémon you want to RNG for. If this is \nyour first Gen 5 RNG, outside of maybe TID/SID and Starter RNG, I recommend \nyou go for a target in an area without any “RNG noise” such as randomly\nmoving NPCs (abbreviated as \"RMNPCs\" for the remainder of this guide) or \nweather. This is because RMNPCs can advance the RNG by varying amounts, whilst \nweather will advance the RNG by a large chunk just before you can start the \nbattle with a Stationary/talk to an NPC to receive a Gift Pokémon making the \nRNG more annoying and difficult. RMNPCs use the PIDrng algorithm to\ndetermine their movement. They can only move and thus advance whilst you're\nstanding or running around in the overworld, but they cannot move whilst \nyou're in e.g. the menu selection screen, the party screen or any other\nsubmenu.\n\nShould you have already battled and killed (not caught) any of the Stationary \nencounters, you can simply beat the Champion and they will respawn in their \noriginal location after.\nIn Gen 5, they unfortunately started to shiny lock some of the available Static \nencounters, so that’s something to keep in mind as well (you can still RNG those \nfor perfect IVs + specific Nature and sometimes gender).\nFollowing is a dropdown selector that will display important information for \nwhichever Pokémon you choose. It includes their location, encounter type, \nwhether they’re shiny locked or not, how many RMNPCs are loaded in and any \nadditional information you may need. There is also a location type for every \nStatic encounter that has RMNPCs nearby (sometimes 2 due to me combining \nsome Foongus and Amoongus that are on the same route into 1 table entry). The \nlocation type can help you determine the exact odds for each possible Advance \namount the RMNPCs can cause with the help of this \nGoogle Sheet.\nThis is NOT required and generally won’t be of too much help, but if \nyou’re curious to learn how RMNPCs work exactly on a more technical level,\nyou can check it out.\nSelect the Game version you're playing and the Pokémon you wish to RNG\nfor. Depending on the encounter type of the Pokémon you choose (Stationary\nvs Gift), the \"Finding a target Seed\" section of this guide will be different \nto accurately reflect noteworthy differences between Stationary and Gift RNG,\nas the largest difference between the two is how to best set up your searcher\ntab (outside of having to battle one but not the other).\nPokémon selector\nThe dropdown is sorted by National Pokédex number descending but with the \nFossils up first and in BW2 only the Yancy/Curtis trades right after as \nlarger grouped entries.\n\n  Select Game Version:\n  \n    BW1\n    \n      BW1\n      BW2\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Select Static Encounter:\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nI will go for Terrakion; it's a Stationary that has 1 randomly moving\nNPC near it in BW2. I'll have to account for that later since I'm\non Black 2.\n\nNote: Weather at Darmanitan, Foongus and Braviary \nIn BW1 only, you can remove any weather, such as the Desert Resorts \npermanent Sandstorm when going for Darmanitan, using this \ntrick.\nThe rain on Route 6 in both BW1 and BW2 depends on the system date \nwhen entering the route; it rains during Spring and Autumn on the \nfollowing dates: 4-5, 12-13, 20-21 and 28-29. To get rid of the Rain, \nsimply load the game on a date it does not rain on, go through a \nloading zone (e.g. enter a house or cave), go back to Route 6 and save \nthe game there. Now, even if you load up the game on a usually rainy \ndate, it will not start raining unless you reload the area or after you \nhave battled a Pokémon. \nFor the Braviary on W2’s Route 4 there is also permanent, not removable \nSandstorm active that will advance the RNG very fast (at 60 Advances per\nsecond) whilst you’re in the overworld and even when the menu selection is up. \nOnce you go to the party menu, these advances stop, so it’s primarily a \nproblem in the menu selection but will also add a LOT of Advances when\nyou're exiting the menu to start the battle with it. There will be notes\nlater explaining this in more detail should you want to go for Braviary.\n\nFinding a target Seed\nStart by opening up PokeFinder, going to the Gen 5 tab and once \nthere opening the Static option.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the Gen 5 Static window's top left make sure the Profile of the \ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile \noption switch to the Searcher tab in which there are 3 different \nsections labeled “RNG Info”, “Settings” and “Filters”.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the RNG Info section, leave the Initial IV Advances, Max IV Advances \nand Lucky Power all at 0. The Initial Advances, Max Advances and date \nrange depend on whether there’s any RMNPCs in the area the Pokémon is in \nand whether you care about getting just a shiny, just specific IVs or both \nat the same time.\nYou can also already select the Category and the Pokémon of that Category\nyou wish to RNG for in the Settings section. In my case, since I'm going\nfor Terrakion, I'll select the Legends Category and then pick Terrakion.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nFollowing is a table with recommended settings for the Searcher tab and your\nProfile that aim to strike a reasonable balance between Max Advances, the\ndate range and Keypresses. \nRecommended settings\nThe RMNPC Count and corresponding Initial\nAdvances are the exact same for all the options other than the pureshiny\noption, hence why they're in larger cells spanning across the different\noptions below the pureshiny.\n\n  \n      \n        Gift\n        RMNPC Count\n        Initial Advances\n        Max Advances\n        Minimum date range\n        Keypresses in Profile\n      \n      \n        Shiny\n        0\n        0\n        0\n        1 Day\n        0\n      \n      \n        1\n        2\n      \n      \n        2\n        4\n      \n      \n        3\n        6\n      \n      \n        5\n        12\n      \n      \n        6\n        14\n      \n      \n        Shiny &amp; Nature\n        \n          \n            0\n            1–3\n            4+\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            0\n            20\n            30\n          \n        \n        10\n        1 Day\n        0\n      \n      \n      \n        1/2 IV &amp; Nature\n        10\n        1 Day\n        0\n      \n      \n      \n        5 IV &amp; Nature\n        25\n        1 Month\n        0, 1, 2\n      \n      \n      \n        6 IV &amp; Nature\n        25\n        6 Months\n        0, 1, 2\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 1/2 IV &amp; Nature\n        100\n        1 Week\n        0, 1, 2\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 5 IV &amp; Nature\n        500\n        1 Year\n        0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 6 IV &amp; Nature\n        1000\n        5 Years\n        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n      \n      \n    \n\n\n  \n      \n        Stationary\n        RMNPC Count\n        Initial Advances\n        Max Advances\n        Minimum date range\n        Keypresses in Profile\n        Sync lead\n      \n      \n        Shiny\n        0\n        0\n        0\n        1 Day\n        0\n        No\n      \n      \n        1\n        2\n      \n      \n        2\n        4\n      \n      \n        3\n        6\n      \n      \n        5\n        12\n      \n      \n        6\n        14\n      \n      \n        Shiny &amp; Nature\n        \n          \n            0\n            1–3\n            4+\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            0\n            20\n            30\n          \n        \n        10\n        1 Day\n        0\n        No\n      \n      \n      \n        1/2 IV &amp; Nature\n        10\n        1 Day\n        0\n        No\n      \n      \n      \n        5 IV &amp; Nature\n        25\n        1 Month\n        0, 1, 2\n        No\n      \n      \n      \n        6 IV &amp; Nature\n        25\n        6 Months\n        0, 1, 2\n        No\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 1/2 IV &amp; Nature\n        100\n        1 Week\n        0, 1, 2\n        No\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 5 IV &amp; Nature\n        500\n        1 Year\n        0, 1, 2, 3\n        Yes\n      \n      \n      \n        Shiny, 6 IV &amp; Nature\n        1000\n        1 Year\n        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n        Yes\n      \n      \n    \n\n  Note: Read this if your target is Braviary in W2 \nIf your target is Braviary, add +244 to the \"Initial Advances\" of the\nbasic shiny option. If you're going for anything else (shiny &amp; Nature\nor anything with specific IVs), add +450 to the \"Initial Advances\"\ninstead. This is due to the Sandstorm advancing the RNG by a LOT whilst\nyou're seeing the season fade-in screen (232 at minimum), and then again\nwhen you're starting the encounter (185 at minimum; together with the\nthe 232 this would only equal 417, but I'd recommend to give yourself\nsome extra space to figure out the Advance you're on in between. So\n450 is just more comfortable).\n\n\nThe Gender of the Pokémon you're going for you can also always easily RNG\nfor if you want to, assuming its not genderless or locked into only being \nmale or only being female. I did not add it to the table because it\nwould've made it look a lot more cluttered.\nThis guide will show you the RNG Process for 2 different possible target\nvariations:\n\n\nHow to get a quick shiny.\nThis option will just explain how you can get a simple shiny quickly\nwithout having to learn the full process including Chatot and more.\nThis will only work if you searched with Max Advances of 0.\n\n\nHow to get a shiny with 5 or 6 perfect IVs + a specific Nature (+possibly \ngender where applicable).\nHere you'll learn the full RNG process, so you'll be able to get \nany combination of shiny + IVs + Nature + gender you desire.\n\n\nIf this is your first Static RNG, I'd recommend to go for just a shiny.\nIf you do not know your SID, you can go for 5 perfect IVs + a specific\nNature instead.\n\nIf this is not your first RNG or you're ignoring my recommendation\nand you are going for the combination of shiny &amp; 5/6 IV however, there's\nanother important thing to note and that is about Lead Abilities. Some \nPokémon's abilities have out of battle effects that affect how Wild \nand Stationary encounters generate. PokeFinder lets you search for\npotential target Seeds with a selected Lead Ability.\nThe primary one we care about is Synchronize as it affects all Stationary \nencounters and can make finding a target Seed (assuming you’re looking \nfor a specific Nature) much faster. Unfortunately Lead Abilities do not \nhave any effect on Gift encounters, so to get a similar amount of results \nfor Gifts compared to Stationary + Synchronize lead, you need to \nhave much larger search ranges.\nThere is also Cute Charm which can give you additional results if\nyour target can be both male and female; so genderless (e.g. Terrakion), \nalways male (e.g. Braviary) or always female (e.g. Mandibuzz) Pokémon, \nCute Charm will NOT work on. Unless you want a specific IV shiny on a \nfairly specific date, it's generally not worth trying to find a target \nSeed using the Cute Charm lead in my opinion.\n\nIf your goal is to only get 5/6 IVs + Nature (+possibly gender) but NOT a\nshiny, you can just follow theshiny, IVs &amp; Nature process. I will explain\nthe difference between going for a shiny and not going for a shiny there.\n\nQuick shiny or with IVs?\nSelect the tab fitting the kind of Pokémon you want to RNG for. Your choice\nwill adjust the remainder of this \"Finding a target Seed\" and the full\n\"The RNG Process\" and \"Troubleshooting\" sections to best instruct you on\nhow to get the kind of Pokémon you want.\n\n  Quick shiny\n  Shiny, IVs &amp; Nature\n\n\nFor the Keypresses I'll have enabled in my Profile, the Initial Advances,\nthe Max Advances and the date range I'll refer to the table with the\nrecommended searcher settings.\n\n  Note: How to change Keypresses \nIn the Static window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\nSince I'm just trying to get a quick shiny in an area with 1 randomly\nmoving NPC I now set the Keypresses to only be 0, the Initial Advances to\n2, the Max Advances to 0 and the date range to be just one day that being\nthe 1st of January 2026 just because that's the day I'm writing this part of\nthe guide on. Adjust the Initial Advances according\nto your target's RMNPC count, if it's not 1 like in my example, and pick\nwhatever date you want to have as the Met Date for this Pokémon later.\nLastly set theshiny option to \"Star/Square\" for the most possible results.\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nNote: What are Star and Square shinies? \nStar and Square shinies are\nONLY differentiated in Pokémon Sword and Shield specifically by having\ndifferent shiny sparkles when sent out into battle. If you either don't\nplan to transfer this Pokémon at all or intend to transfer it to\nliterally any other game (all of Gens 6, 7 and 9 + BDSP, Legends: Arceus\nand Legends: Z-A), this difference does not exist.\n\nNow you can hit the Search button and let PokeFinder search for\npotential targets. Should you get no results at all, make sure you didn't\naccidentally input any filters for IVs or Nature. If there's still no\nresults at all, try changing your date range to a different day.\n\n    \n    \n  \nI will pick this Gentle Nature Seed here at Advance 50 on the 1st of\nJanuary 2026 at 20:57:19 because the target second in 19 is the lowest\nout of the options PokeFinder gave me that EonTimer will allow me to go\nfor with my EonTimer settings. If you are on 3DS you'll probably want\nto pick a target closer to 40-55 seconds due to its much longer loading\ntimes; but only if you have the choice. It's not required by any means,\nbut will just make each attempt a little bit faster.\n\n\nBefore we continue, we'll want to import an IV Cache into our Profile\nto significantly speed up the target Seed search. Should you already have\nan IV Cache from getting a perfect IV Starter, you can skip the next 5\nimages and continue at \"Now back to finding a target Seed\".\nFor this we need to download the IV Cache first. You can get it from\nthe Assets on PokeFinder's GitHub page.\nI'll pick the 0-5 IV Advance Cache so I'll have more options if I\nwant to do some advanced IV advancement methods in the future (not\ndiscussed in this guide). It also costs less than 1 MB space more than\nthe one with only IV Advance 0, so I don't see a point in ever choosing\nthe Advance 0 file. I\nrecommend you save it in the PokeFinder folder so you can easily find\nit again later. Should you accidentally delete the file you can always\njust redownload it.\n\n    \n    \n  \nIn the main window of PokeFinder go to Gen 5 Tools at the top, open the\nProfile Manager and once there, select the Profile of the game you wish to\ndo this RNG in and click the edit button at the top.\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \nA smaller Profile Editor window will pop up with 2 empty fields in the\nbottom right labeled IV Cache and SHA Cache. Click on the Select File\nbutton next to the IV Cache and PokeFinder will open your file explorer in\nthe folder you saved PokeFinder in.\n\n    \n    \n  \nHere select the IV Cache file you downloaded earlier. The SHA Cache you can\nignore for now. It's primarily useful for wild RNG when you're going for\nhighly specific targets and cuts down the search time even further.\n\n    \n    \n  \nNow back to finding a target Seed.\nFor the Keypresses I'll have enabled in my Profile, the Initial Advances,\nthe Max Advances and the date range I'll refer to the table with the\nrecommended searcher settings.\n\n  Note: How to change Keypresses \nIn the Static window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\nSince I want my Terrakion to have 5 IVs at a perfect 31 value, I put the IV\nranges to only look for 31 Hitpoints, Attack, Defense, Special Defense and\nSpeed by putting the Min of those stats to 31 (whilst the Max was already\nat 31). The Special Attack I'll leave at 0-31, as I don't care how high or\nlow of a Special Attack IV my Terrakion will get.\nFor getting a 5 IV shiny Stationary with a specific Nature in an area with\n1 randomly moving NPC, I now set the Keypresses to include 0, 1, 2 and 3,\nthe Initial Advances to 20 since there's 1 RMNPC near Terrakion in BW2,\nthe Max Advances to 500 and the date range to be a full year that being\nthe entirety of 2026, because 2026 just began as I'm writing this guide.\nAdjust the Initial Advances according to your target's RMNPC count if it's\nnot 1 like in my example and pick whatever date range you want to (your\ntarget Seeds date will decide your Pokémon's Met Date later).\nI will also search with a Synchronize lead for a Jolly Nature to greatly\nincrease the amount of potential target Seeds PokeFinder can give me\n(Leads are only possible with Stationaries, so Gift encounters won't even\nhave the Lead option in the top left). Lastly input your desired IVs &amp;\nNature and set theshiny option to \"Star/Square\" for the most possible\nresults.\n\nNote: What are Star and Square shinies? \nStar and Square shinies are\nONLY differentiated in Pokémon Sword and Shield specifically by having\ndifferent shiny sparkles when sent out into battle. If you either don't\nplan to transfer this Pokémon at all or intend to transfer it to\nliterally any other game (all of Gens 6, 7 and 9 + BDSP, Legends: Arceus\nand Legends: Z-A), this difference does not exist.\n\nOnce done, your searcher may look something like this:\n\n    \n    \n  \nNow you can hit the Search button and let PokeFinder search for\npotential targets.\n\nNote: What to do if you get no results\nEven with these search ranges you are not guaranteed to find a target\nSeed. If you used the recommended ranges and got nothing, you can expand\nthem as you see fit using any one (or a combination of) these 3 options:\n\n1. Change the date range\nBy adjusting the Start and End Date to search through other months or\nyears, you are very likely to find a target Seed. This option has\nno downsides. Unless of course you want to have a somewhat or even \nexactly specific \"Met Date\" on the Pokémon for personal reasons.\n2. Adjust the Initial Advances\nIf you already searched e.g. with 20 Initial Advances and 500 Max\nAdvances through the entire year of 2025 trying to find a shiny &amp; \n5 IV target Seed but got nothing, do not waste your time partially\nrepeating that search by just increasing the Max Advances; this would\nonly have PokeFinder search through Advance amounts of 20-520 again\n(which still get you no results with the same date range as before) \nand only after it would start checking the now higher Max Advances. \nInstead adjust the Initial Advances to e.g. be 520 so it starts \nsearching after your previously searched range.\nWith this you are also very likely to find a target Seed, in exchange\nhowever a higher target Advance number also means having to spend \nmore time later advancing the RNG in-game. Especially when going for \na target that's several hundred or possibly even over a thousand \nAdvances away, this will make the RNG very lengthy.\n3. Increase Keypresses\nTo increase the Keypresses (aka the amount of buttons to hold whilst\nthe game is starting up; will be explained further later), simply edit \nyour Profile in the Profile Manager and check off more options in the \nKeypresses dropdown. Every additional Keypress amount that you enable \nwill open up a lot more potential target Seeds for PokeFinder to find.\n\nIf you are already at up to 5 Keypresses, I would not recommend to\nincrease it further, as starting at 6 the button combinations become\nincreasingly more difficult and sometimes painful to press and hold.\nBut you can of course give it a try if you wish and there is certainly\nsome combinations that are still reasonably easy to do even with 6 or\nmore buttons at a time.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \nI will pick this Jolly Terrakion Seed here on the 16th of January 2026 at\n05:59:16, at Advance 304 because the target second is 19, which is the\nfastest target second EonTimer will allow me to go for with my EonTimer\nsettings out of the Seed options PokeFinder gave me. If you are on 3DS\nyou'll probably want to pick a target closer to 40-55 seconds due to its\nmuch longer loading times; but only if you have the choice. It's not\nrequired by any means but will just make each attempt a little bit faster.\nThe target Advance being 304 is also fairly good; will only require me to do\nabout 250 Advances myself when it could've been as much as 500 with my\nSearcher settings. There are 3 Keypresses in the Start and Y buttons and the Up\ndirection on the D-pad that I'll have to press and hold during startup of the\ngame. Since I have theshiny Charm on my save file already, there's another\nshiny Advance immediately after my target, so that's neat in case I advance\nby 1 too many on accident; without the shiny Charm you won't get such\nconsecutive shiny Advances.\nOur final bit of preparation will be for the Generator tab in PokeFinder.\nCopy your target Seed from the Searcher tab (e.g. using a keyboard shortcut\nlike ctrl+c on Windows), switch to the Generator tab in the top left and\npaste the Seed into the Seed field. Now select your target Pokémon's Category\nand then the Pokémon itself and input any Lead info in the top left if\nrequired (as said before for Gift encounters, the Lead option isn't there).\nI am going for a Synchronize Lead with a Jolly Nature so that's what I\nput in there.\n\n    \n    \n  \nNow it's important that you do NOT touch the Filters section on the right for\nnow; this would only hide some of the Advances that do not fit whatever you\nput into those Filters, thus making it impossible to later track what Advance\nwe're on.\nOnce done, press the Generate button and the Generator tab should look\nsomething like this:\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nThe RNG process\n\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seed's\nseconds (19 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date\nto the target date (here the 1st of January 2026) and get ready\nto change and confirm the target time (20:57 for me; should EonTimer\nsay \"Minutes Before Target: 1\" and your target time is e.g.\n12:30:05, you'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS instead).\n\n  \nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu,\nget ready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of\nEonTimer sounds and right after make sure to not press any\nbuttons until the star appears on the top screen.\n\nNow continue getting into the game. Once you click continue on the\nsave file selection screen, disable the C-Gear and then start spamming\nthe A button to make the season showing screen fade faster and right after\nimmediately start the Encounter/take the Gift. Being as fast as possible\nhere is only important if there is any RMNPCs near your target Pokémon, as\nRMNPCs can already start moving, and thus advance the RNG, whilst the game\nis showing you the current season. If there are 0 RMNPCs in the area according\nto the \"Pokémon selector\", you can take your time here.\nIf you're lucky, you will have the shiny Static of your dreams now (if\nyour target was a Stationary, you'll have to catch it first of course), in \nwhich case you can skip to \"Next steps…\".\n\n\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seed's\nseconds (27 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date\nto the target date (here the 11th of November 2026) and get ready\nto change and confirm the target time (06:15 for me; should EonTimer\nsay \"Minutes Before Target: 1\" and your target time is e.g.\n12:30:05, you'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS instead).\nAlso double check what buttons you'll need to press.\n\n  \nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu,\nget ready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of\nEonTimer sounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons\nyour target Seed may require (start pressing the buttons right \nafter you started the game and you can let go once the star appears\non the top screen). I will need to press and hold the Select and Y\nbuttons and the Up direction on the D-pad.\n\nNow continue getting into the game. Once you click continue on the\nsave file selection screen, immediately start spamming the A button\nto make the season showing screen fade faster and once it starts fading\nimmediately start spamming the X button to open up the menu. But be\ncareful to not spam for too long as the menu can also be closed using the\nX button. Being as fast as possible here is only important if there is any\nRMNPCs near your target Pokémon, as RMNPCs can already start moving, and \nthus advance the RNG, whilst the game is showing you the current season.\nIf there are 0 RMNPCs in the area according to the\nPokémon Selector, you can take your time here.\nNow go into your party and it's time to advance the RNG to reach your target\nAdvance. For this we will use Chatot. If you do not have access to Chatot,\nyou can also use saving the game to Advance the RNG, though it will take\nsignificantly longer and is extremely unreliable if there's any RMNPCs around.\n\n  Note: What's the target Advance if I'm not going for a shiny? \nIn the Searcher tab you will still have been shown your target Advance, it's\njust less obvious to find in the Generator tab. Since the IVs are the same on\nevery PIDrng Advance, due to the IVrng not being advanced, you can just choose\nany Advance that has the Nature (+possibly Gender) that you want your Pokémon\nto have. You don't necessarily have to go for the target Advance that was\nspecified in the Searcher tab when not going for a shiny.\n\nSelect the tab fitting the method you want to advance the RNG with:\n\n  Chatot\n  Saving\n\n\nIn the Generator tab of the Static window you can see the Chatot column.\nWith a custom Chatter recording, whenever you view the summary of a\nChatot in e.g. the party screen, the game picks a value between 0-99 at\nrandom and, depending on how high of a number it rolls, the Chatot's cry \n(commonly just referred to as the \"Chatter\") will sound anywhere from \nvery deep (lower value) to very high (higher value). Due to this\nrandomization, each time you listen to a Chatter, the RNG Advances\nforward by 1 to decide how low or high pitched exactly it should sound \nthat time.\nNow you may be tempted to just count how often you listen to the Chatters\nand then do the encounter but please DON'T do this. There's many potential\nRNG noise factors, such as RMNPCs, that can influence the RNG Advance you\nstart at without you knowing about it causing you to miss your target.\nInstead carefully listen to the pitches of your Chatot and try to follow\nalong with the Generator tabs Chatot column. I recommend to focus on the\nreally low and really high sounding Chatters only; we humans aren't made for\ndistinguishing between pitches that are close to each other (e.g. a pitch\nwith a value of 45 will sound almost exactly the same as a pitch with a value\nof 55 to us). Once you've done a few RNGs and gotten used to your Chatter, you\nwill get better at differentiating the different pitches.\nIf you're RNGing a Pokémon without any RMNPCs around, the first Chatter\nyou'll hear if you hit your target Seed is the very first one shown in\nthe Generator tab. The exact Advance number you start at will differ from\nSeed to Seed but is generally between ~35-55 in BW1 and ~40-60 in BW2.\nIf you're RNGing a Pokémon with RMNPCs around like I am doing with\nTerrakion however, there will most likely be additional Advances happening\nbefore you can open up the menu.\nHow many Advances that is exactly depends on both the RNG state and the\nspecific area you're in. For Terrakion, which has 1 RMNPC and a location\ntype of 1, there's about a 55% chance that this RMNPC will Advance the RNG\nby 2 whilst I'm loading into the game and seeing the current season if I\nspam A and after X optimally. The precise odds you don't really need to\nknow but instead just take this general rule of thumb:\n1 RMNPC = ~2 Advances whilst loading in if you open the menu as fast as possible\n2 RMNPCs = ~4 Advances\n3 RMNPCs = ~6 Advances\n5 RMNPCs = ~12 Advances\n6 RMNPCs = ~14 Advances\n8 RMNPCs = ~18 Advances\n\n  Note: Read this if your target is Braviary in W2 part 2 \nWhilst there are no RMNPCs loaded in at Braviary specifically (if you saved\nright of it), the Sandstorm will advance a LOT when loading into the game.\nWith perfect timing for spamming A to make the season fade in screen go away\nfaster, immediate spamming X to open up the menu and then instantly spamming\nA again to get to the party submenu (since the Sandstorm advances whilst the\nmenu selection is up), 232 Advances will have happened. Due to human error,\nit's more likely to end up being between 232-244 (assuming no mistakes like\naccidentally closing the menu selection again by having spammed X for too long).\n\nThe higher the RMNPC number, the less stable this becomes. Whilst 2 RMNPCs\nfor example have about a 33% chance of causing the most likely Advance\nnumber in 4, 6 RMNPCs only have about a 12% chance to hit their most\nlikely Advance number in 14. So if your target has a higher RMNPC count,\nit'll be more difficult to figure out what RNG Advance exactly you're on\nafter loading into the game.\nBack to the RNG; after 7 attempts of Chatter patterns that sounded nothing\nlike my target Seeds pattern, I got these as the first 10 Chatters:\n\n  \n    \n  Your browser does not support the audio element.\n  \n  \nIt starts with a fairly low pitch, then goes to a medium/high, another\nmedium/high, a low, 3 highs in a row, a medium and finally 2 highs in a\nrow. This matches the Chatters from Advance 50 to Advance 59 perfectly,\nso I know that I am now on target Seed.\n\n    \n    \n  \nMy predicted 2 Advances from the RMNPC when loading into the game were correct\nthis time, making me start on Advance 50 instead of this Seeds starting Advance\nof 48. These predictions for areas with RMNPCs are not perfect however and\nstarting on a later or earlier Advance was also very possible. This does give\nyou a good idea about where to start looking for the Chatter pitches though.\nWith the Chatter of Advance 59 being the last one I heard, I can start\nadvancing towards my target by just flipping between my two Chatot as fast\nas the game will allow me to. You do NOT have to let a Chatter play out in\nfull; just the act of opening/switching to the summary of a Chatot is\nenough for the RNG Advance to happen.\nKeep advancing now following along with the Chatter pitches until you're\nexactly 1 Advance away from your target.\n\n  Note: Read this if your target is Braviary in W2 part 3 \nDue to the Sandstorm, you'll need to stop 185 Advances before your\ntarget for Braviary. During testing I did get 181 and 189 as well, but\nonly on tests that were over a year old and I could not replicate again\nrecently; so if 185 doesn't work out, it may be useful to try 181 or\n189 as well.\nAlso make sure to keep spamming A until the battle with it actually\nstarts, as there is one additional text box you have to click away\nduring which the Sandstorm still advances.\n\nMy target Seeds shiny is on Advance 304 so I stop on Advance 303.\nHere is an audio sample of my final 10 Chatters:\n\n  \n    \n  Your browser does not support the audio element.\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \nNow finally we get our shiny. Whilst still in the party menu, press X to\nclose it and then immediately start spamming the A button (or hold ↑ for\nZoroark / → for Lati@s) to start the battle with the Stationary / get\ngiven the Gift Pokémon. You can again take your time if there are no\nRMNPCs in the area.\nIf all went well, you will have the shiny Static of your dreams now (if\nyour target was a Stationary you'll have to catch it first of course), in\nwhich case you can skip to \"Next steps…\". \n\n\nIf you do not have Chatot, you can use saving the game to advance the\nRNG. It will be significantly slower and is much more inconsistent if\nthere are any RMNPCs nearby.\nIn the Generator tab of the Static window you can see the Chatot column.\nThere you can track the Advance you're currently on by using the starting\nposition of the Save Needle like you may have used during Profile\ncalibration via the Save Needle or Unova Link method. Here is a table of\nwhat Chatter value in the Generator tab corresponds to which Save Needle\nstarting position:\n\n    \n      Chatter pitch number\n      Save Needle starting position\n    \n    \n      0-12\n      ↑\n    \n    \n      13-24\n      ↗\n    \n    \n      25-36\n      →\n    \n    \n      37-49\n      ↘\n    \n    \n      50-61\n      ↓\n    \n    \n      62-74\n      ↙\n    \n    \n      75-86\n      ←\n    \n    \n      87-99\n      ↖\n    \n  \nThe edge numbers between 2 adjacent Save Needle starting positions can also\nsometimes be the other one; probably due to some rounding the game does. So\nin some cases e.g. a 12 may be a ↗ or a 13 may be a ↑ despite it usually\nbeing the other way around.\nIf you're RNGing a Pokémon without any RMNPCs around, the first Save Needle\nstarting position you'll see if you hit your target Seed is the very first\none shown in the Generator tab. The exact Advance number you start at will\ndiffer from Seed to Seed but is generally between ~35-55 in BW1 and ~40-60\nin BW2.\nIf you're RNGing a Pokémon with RMNPCs around like I am doing with\nTerrakion however, there will most likely be additional Advances happening\nbefore you can open up the menu.\nHow many Advances that is exactly depends on both the RNG state and the\nspecific area you're in. For Terrakion, which has 1 RMNPC and a location\ntype of 1, there's about a 55% chance that this RMNPC will Advance the RNG\nby 2 whilst I'm loading into the game and seeing the current season if I\nspam A and after X optimally. The precise odds you don't really need to\nknow but instead just take this general rule of thumb:\n1 RMNPC = ~2 Advances whilst loading in if you open the menu as fast as possible\n2 RMNPCs = ~4 Advances\n3 RMNPCs = ~6 Advances\n5 RMNPCs = ~12 Advances\n6 RMNPCs = ~14 Advances\n8 RMNPCs = ~18 Advances\nThe higher the RMNPC number, the less stable this becomes. Whilst 2 RMNPCs\nfor example have about a 33% chance of causing the most likely Advance\nnumber in 4, 6 RMNPCs only have about a 12% chance to hit their most\nlikely Advance number in 14. So if your target has a higher RMNPC count,\nit'll be more difficult to figure out what RNG Advance exactly you're on\nafter loading into the game.\nYou also need to be quick in between each save. After saving the game you're\nforced to close out of the menu and get back to the overworld for a short moment.\nIf you're as fast as possible with opening up the menu again after (you first\ngotta press A to make the \"saved the game\" message go away and then click X to\nopen the menu back up), that moment is only 1/30th of a second long (1 frame\nat 30fps), but realistically it'll be closer to 3-5 frames. So it is possible\nthat the RMNPCs advance the RNG in between you saving the game twice making it\nmuch harder to track the current Advance and figure out whether you're even on\nyour target Seed.\nBack to the RNG; after 7 attempts of Save Needle patterns that looked nothing\nlike my target Seeds pattern, I got these as the first 10 Save Needles:\n↑,\n↓,\n↙,\n↗,\n←,\n↙,\n←,\n↓,\n↖ and finally\n←.\nComparing the Chatters on our target Seed with the Save Needle table, we can\nsee that the Needles match the Chatters from Advance 53 to Advance 63\nperfectly, so I am now on target Seed.\n\n    \n    \n  \nMy predicted 2 Advances from the RMNPC when loading into the game were correct\nthis time, making me start on Advance 50 instead of this Seeds starting Advance\nof 48. These predictions for areas with RMNPCs are not perfect however and\nstarting on a later or earlier Advance was also very possible. This does give\nyou a good idea about where to start looking for the Save Needle patterns\nthough.\nThe MH 61 of Advance 51, MH 74 from Advance 55 and M 50 from Advance 57 could\nalso each have been the other Needle adjacent to it (\n↙ for MH 61, ←\nfor MH 74 and ↘ for M 50), so that's something\nto keep in mind when checking the Needles as well. For me they all matched the\ncommon case though.\nWith the Needle of Advance 59 being the last one I saw, I can start\nadvancing towards my target by saving the game repeatedly.\nKeep advancing now following along with the Chatter pitches converted to\nSave Needles using the table until you're exactly 1 Advance away from your\ntarget. My target Seeds shiny is on Advance 304 so I stop on Advance 303\nwhen I see my final MH 29 = →.\n\n    \n    \n  \nNow finally we get our shiny. Close the \"saved the game\" message and\nimmediately start spamming the A button (or hold ↑ for Zoroark / →\nfor Lati@s) to begin the battle with the Stationary / get given the\nGift Pokémon. You can again take your time if there are no RMNPCs in\nthe area.\nIf all went well, you will have the shiny Static of your dreams now (if\nyour target was a Stationary you'll have to catch it first of course), in\nwhich case you can skip to \"Next steps…\". \nIf it did not shine, but you were absolutely certain that you tracked the\nRNG Advances correctly using Chatot/Save Needles, there is a chance the\nRMNPCs Advanced in between you closing the menu and starting the encounter\n/receiving the Pokémon. With perfect inputs, this is only a 1 frame window\nmaking the odds of it happening very low, though it is still possible. In\nthat case you should just try again and odds are good that there'll be no\nextra Advances at the end next time.\n\n\nOtherwise just try again 4 more times if you're on BW1 and 9 more times\nif you're on BW2. If even after those additional attempts you still did\nnot get it, do not shut off your game yet (though you can put it into sleep\nmode) and continue on to the Troubleshooting section.\nTroubleshooting\nBut what if after 5 attempts in BW1 or 10 attempts in BW2 you still have\nnot gotten the shiny or, if you're going for shiny + IVs + Nature, you can\nnever seem to hit your target Seed since the Chatter pitches you hear\n(/Save Needle starting positions you see) don't make any sense?\nIn that case we'll try to find whether you're just getting Timer0'd (aka\nthe game just doesn't want to give you your target Timer0), the RMNPCs are\nmessing you up if there's any present or whether there's something else\ngoing wrong. For this we'll use the IVs of the Pokémon you encountered\non your last RNG attempt (if you quit the game already after your last\nattempt, do another one) and the Profile Calibrator.\nIn the main window of PokeFinder go to Gen 5 Tools at the top and open\nup the Profile Calibrator.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nIn the left half of the window, make sure the IV tab is selected and\ninput the date and time of the target Seed you've been going for. In\nmy case that's the 1st of January 2026 at 20:57.\n\n  \n  \n\nThen in the right half you start by selecting the game version,\nlanguage, console you play on and add your console's MAC\naddress which can be found in the internet settings of your console\n(you can also just copy it from the Profile of the game you've been using).\nAlso check the Memory Link checkbox if you have activated Memory\nLink on this current save file (BW2 exclusive feature; I did connect\na Black 1 with this Black 2 save file using Memory Link so I have to check\noff the box).\nPut the seconds Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -1 and\n+1 if you're on DS or DS Lite and to -3 and +3 if you're on DSi or 3DS.\nMy target second is 19 and I'm doing this RNG on a DS so I'm gonna put\nthe Min Second to 19-1=18 and the Max Second to 19+1=20.\n\n  \n  \n\nFinally we need to change the VCount, Timer0 and VFrame ranges. You will\ntake those in part from your current games Profile. Put both the Min and\nthe Max VCount and the Min and Max VFrame to be the ones you have in your\nProfile. In my case that's 82 for the VCount and 8 for the VFrame (if you're\none of the rare cases that can have more than 1 VCount like having both AC\nand AD, put the lower of the two like AC as the Min and the higher of the\ntwo like AD as the Max VCount).\nFor the Timer0 it's a bit different between BW1 and BW2.\nIn BW1 you just put it to the two Timer0's you got during calibration. If\nyou only got 1 Timer0 (e.g. C70), put the Min Timer0 to that one -1 and the\nMax Timer0 to that one +1 (e.g. Min C6F and Max C71).\nIn BW2 you should put it to the full range of Timer0's you got during Profile\ncalibration -1 and +1. I got all the Timer0s from 1101 to 1106 during my\ncalibration so now I'll calculate -1 and +1 to get 1100 and 1107 and\nput those as my Min and Max Timer0 into the Profile Calibrator. If you\ndid not write down the full Timer0 range you got, shame on you lol, but that's\nnot the end of the world. You can instead just use the following input field to\ncalculate your most common Timer0 -A and +A. You can use the\nfollowing input field to calculate this new Profiles Min and Max Timer0\nbased on your most common Timer0, if you don't know your full range.\n\n  \n  Timer0 Min: 0\n  Timer0 Max: 0\n\nThis will give you a\nlarger Timer0 range than you can actually hit, thus making you get more\ninvalid results than otherwise, but it's still going to be very helpful\nin determining what you hit. Just not quite as efficient as knowing your\nactual Timer0 range would be. If I didn't know my full range already, I'd\njust input 1106 for example, as that is my most common Timer0, and this\ncalculator would return me 10FC as the Min and 1110 as the Max.\n\n  \n  \n\nOpen up the IV Calculator in the Profile Calibrator and select the Generation\n5 games. Then input the target Pokémon's species, its Nature, characteristic,\nlevel, stats and press the Find IVs button. You can ignore the Hidden Power\nfor now.\n\nNote: The Characteristics of your Pokémon are not in PokeFinder? \nFor English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were\nchanged in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for\nthese, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar\nissue, but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's\nCharacteristics change, so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you\nmay have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokémon wiki site of\nthat language for example.\n\n\nThis is the Terrakion I last got and the IV Calculator results:\n\n\n  \n  \n\nSwitch back over to the Profile Calibrator. The calculated IV ranges should\nautomatically have been transferred to it. Press Search and see what result(s)\nit gets you.\n\n  \n  \n\nThere are 3 options for what happens here; choose the tab fitting your\nsituation:\n\nYou got exactly 1 result\nYou got 2 or more results\nYou got no results\n\n\n1 result\n \nThis means that it is most certainly what you actually hit.\nIf both the second you hit matches your target Seeds target second and the\nTimer0 you hit matches your target Timer0, you hit your target Seed. The\ncalculated IV ranges should fit the IVs of that target Seed as well. If they\ndo not, you likely made an error in the \"Finding a target Seed\" section.\nShould there be no RMNPCs near your target in this case, you also\nlikely made an error in the \"Finding your target Seed\" section and should\ngo back to that.\nIf however there is at least 1 RMNPC nearby, it's the RMNPC that made you\nmiss your target. The RNG Advance you hit when there's an RMNPC nearby is\ndependant both on the RNG Advances themselves and the last saved position\nof the RMNPCs. The RNG Advances we cannot change, as they're fixed on your\ntarget Seed, but the last saved position we sure can influence. We will\nreposition the RMNPCs by loading into the game normally (you can just e.g.\nsoft reset from your last RNG attempt), standing idly in the overworld for\n5-10 seconds and then saving the game. With a different saved position\nthe RMNPCs will advance the RNG differently than last time and hopefully\nin just the right way so you can get your shiny. You may need to\nreposition the RMNPCs several times before you can get your shiny\ndepending on your luck. The more RMNPCs are near your target, the\nmore often you'll have to do this on average as well. Generally\nI'd recommend to only reposition them whenever you did actually hit\nyour target Timer0, not when you hit some other Timer0.\nIf the second you hit is equal to your target second, but the\nTimer0 is different, you have simply been getting Timer0'd. In this\ncase just try again and if it's not shiny again, check what you hit\nusing the Profile Calibrator. If after 10+ attempts in BW1 or 20+\nattempts in BW2 you still only hit Timer0's that are different from\nyour target Timer0, it may be best to switch to a different target\nSeed in the hopes of that one being less unlucky and getting you your\ntarget Timer0 faster.\nIf the second you hit is different than your target second, regardless\nof whether the Timer0 matches your target or not, do another\nattempt and see if it's off again. If it's off both times, you should\ncalibrate your EonTimer by putting the second you hit (not your\ntarget) into the second hit field at the bottom and pressing the Update\nbutton once. This will adjust your Calibration value to make it so\nnext time you will hit your target second. If you're on DSi or\nespecially on 3DS, the seconds you hit tend to be inconsistent, so it\nmay be better to do 3-4 more attempts before adjusting EonTimer to\nfigure out what second you hit most of the time and only then updating\nthe timer.\n \n2+ results\n \n\nOne of those is most certainly what you actually hit.\nTo find out which it is exactly, you should level up the Pokémon you\ngot, input the next level and its stats into the IV Calculator and\npress Find IVs again. It is highly recommended you use Rare Candies\nfor this, as if you level up the Pokémon via battles, it will gain\nEVs which will throw off the IV Calculators results. In that case\nyou'd have to keep track of the exact EVs you gain and use an IV\nCalculator that can keep track of EVs as well (e.g.\nMetalKids IV Calculator website).\nFinding out the Hidden Power type may also be useful for\nnarrowing down the IVs further if needed, but if you have a few Rare\nCandies it'll be significantly faster to just use those. You can find\nthe Hidden Power Judge in Mistralton City's Pokémon Center in BW1 or\nat the PWT in BW2. Once narrowed down to 1 result, switch to the \"1\nresult\" tab.\n\n  \n  \n\n \nNo results\n \n\nThis means that there's something going wrong.\nDouble check all the date and time settings of your DS and PokeFinder\nmatch exactly, make sure you were using the correct Profile, that\nthere's not a typo in your MAC address and check if you have selected\nthe correct game version and language. If you spotted an error correct\nit and try again, but even if you did not spot anything, still try one\nmore time.\nIf after all this you still cannot seem to find anything, join im a blisy\n._.'s RNG manip assistance Discord server\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of\nthe issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder Calibration\nwindow and EonTimer.\n \n\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my case I just got Timer0'd as the second I hit is equal to my target\nsecond, but the Timer0 is different. I will just continue on until I hit\nmy target Seed now.\n\n\nIn the left half of the window, make sure the IV tab is selected and\ninput the date and time of the target Seed you've been going for. In\nmy case that's the 16th of January 2026 at 05:59.\n\n  \n  \n\nThen in the right half you start by selecting the game version,\nlanguage, console you play on and add your console's MAC\naddress which can be found in the internet settings of your console\n(you can also just copy it from the Profile of the game you've been using).\nAlso check the Memory Link checkbox if you have activated Memory\nLink on this current save file (BW2 exclusive feature; I did connect\na Black 1 with this Black 2 save file using Memory Link so I have to check\noff the box). Also make sure to check off any Keypresses you did. I had to\npress and hold Up, L and R so I'll check off those 3 Keypresses.\nPut the seconds Min and Max to your EonTimer target seconds -1 and\n+1 if you're on DS or DS Lite and to -3 and +3 if you're on DSi or 3DS.\nMy target second is 19 and I'm doing this RNG on a DS so I'm gonna put\nthe Min Second to 19-1=18 and the Max Second to 19+1=20.\n\n  \n  \n\nFinally we need to change the VCount, Timer0 and VFrame ranges. You will\ntake those in part from your current games Profile. Put both the Min and\nthe Max VCount and the Min and Max VFrame to be the ones you have in your\nProfile. In my case that's 82 for the VCount and 8 for the VFrame (if you're\none of the rare cases that can have more than 1 VCount like having both AC\nand AD, put the lower of the two like AC as the Min and the higher of the\ntwo like AD as the Max VCount).\nFor the Timer0 it's a bit different between BW1 and BW2.\nIn BW1 you just put it to the two Timer0's you got during calibration. If\nyou only got 1 Timer0 (e.g. C70), put the Min Timer0 to that one -1 and the\nMax Timer0 to that one +1 (e.g. Min C6F and Max C71).\nIn BW2 you should put it to the full range of Timer0's you got during Profile\ncalibration -1 and +1. I got all the Timer0s from 1101 to 1106 during my\ncalibration so now I'll calculate -1 and +1 to get 1100 and 1107 and\nput those as my Min and Max Timer0 into the Profile Calibrator. If you\ndid not write down the full Timer0 range you got, shame on you lol, but that's\nnot the end of the world. You can instead just use the following input field to\ncalculate your most common Timer0 -A and +A. You can use the\nfollowing input field to calculate this new Profiles Min and Max Timer0\nbased on your most common Timer0, if you don't know your full range.\n\n  \n  Timer0 Min: 0\n  Timer0 Max: 0\n\nThis will give you a\nlarger Timer0 range than you can actually hit, thus making you get more\ninvalid results than otherwise, but it's still going to be very helpful\nin determining what you hit. Just not quite as efficient as knowing your\nactual Timer0 range would be. If I didn't know my full range already, I'd\njust input 1106 for example, as that is my most common Timer0, and this\ncalculator would return me 10FC as the Min and 1110 as the Max.\n\n  \n  \n\nOpen up the IV Calculator in the Profile Calibrator and select the Generation\n5 games. Then input the target Pokémon's species, its Nature, characteristic,\nlevel, stats and press the Find IVs button. You can ignore the Hidden Power\nfor now.\n\nNote: The Characteristics of your Pokémon are not in PokeFinder? \nFor English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were\nchanged in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for\nthese, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar\nissue, but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's\nCharacteristics change, so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you\nmay have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokémon wiki site of\nthat language for example.\n\n\nThis is the Terrakion I last got and the IV Calculator results:\n\n\n  \n  \n\nSwitch back over to the Profile Calibrator. The calculated IV ranges should\nautomatically have been transferred to it. Press Search and see what result(s)\nit gets you.\n\n  \n  \n\nThere are 3 options for what happens here; choose the tab fitting your\nsituation:\n\nYou got exactly 1 result\nYou got 2 or more results\nYou got no results\n\n\n1 result\n \nThis means that it is most certainly what you actually hit.\nIf both the second you hit matches your target Seeds target second and the\nTimer0 you hit matches your target Timer0, you hit your target Seed. The\ncalculated IV ranges should fit the IVs of that target Seed as well. If they\ndo not, you likely made an error in the \"Finding a target Seed\" section and\nshould go back to that for accurate results.\nShould there be no RMNPCs near your target, but you were unable to identify\nthe Chatter pattern, perhaps try recording a clearer Chatter sound to make\nit easier to differentiate between high and low pitches. Also next attempt\nyou can try to record the Chatters with your phone so you can play them\nback and practice. If you used saving to advance the RNG instead, but you\nwere unable to find where in the RNG you are, check the Chatter pitch to\nSave Needle table again.\nIf however there is at least 1 RMNPC nearby, try again and either record\nthe Chatters so you can play them back again and again to compare with the\nSeeds Advances, or instead of trying to do any Chatot, immediately encounter\n/get the Pokémon next time and try to deduce what Advance you start on\nusing its Nature, Characteristic and (if applicable) Gender.\nIf the second you hit is equal to your target second, but the\nTimer0 is different, you have simply been getting Timer0'd. In this\ncase just try again and if it's not shiny again, check what you hit\nusing the Profile Calibrator. If after 10+ attempts in BW1 or 20+\nattempts in BW2 you still only hit Timer0's that are different from\nyour target Timer0, it may be best to switch to a different target\nSeed in the hopes of that one being less unlucky and getting you your\ntarget Timer0 faster.\nIf the second you hit is different than your target second, regardless\nof whether the Timer0 matches your target or not, do another\nattempt and see if it's off again. If it's off both times, you should\ncalibrate your EonTimer by putting the second you hit (not your\ntarget) into the second hit field at the bottom and pressing the Update\nbutton once. This will adjust your Calibration value to make it so\nnext time you will hit your target second. If you're on DSi or\nespecially on 3DS, the seconds you hit tend to be inconsistent, so it\nmay be better to do 3-4 more attempts before adjusting EonTimer to\nfigure out what second you hit most of the time and only then updating\nthe timer.\n \n2+ results\n \n\nOne of those is most certainly what you actually hit.\nTo find out which it is exactly, you should level up the Pokémon you\ngot, input the next level and its stats into the IV Calculator and\npress Find IVs again. It is highly recommended you use Rare Candies\nfor this, as if you level up the Pokémon via battles, it will gain\nEVs which will throw off the IV Calculators results. In that case\nyou'd have to keep track of the exact EVs you gain and use an IV\nCalculator that can keep track of EVs as well (e.g.\nMetalKids IV Calculator website).\nFinding out the Hidden Power type may also be useful for\nnarrowing down the IVs further if needed, but if you have a few Rare\nCandies it'll be significantly faster to just use those. You can find\nthe Hidden Power Judge in Mistralton City's Pokémon Center in BW1 or\nat the PWT in BW2. Once narrowed down to 1 result, switch to the \"1\nresult\" tab.\n\n  \n  \n\n \nNo results\n \n\nThis means that there's something going wrong.\nDouble check all the date and time settings of your DS and PokeFinder\nmatch exactly, make sure you were using the correct Profile, that\nthere's not a typo in your MAC address and check if you have selected\nthe correct game version and language. If you spotted an error correct\nit and try again, but even if you did not spot anything, still try one\nmore time.\nIf after all this you still cannot seem to find anything, join im a blisy\n._.'s RNG manip assistance Discord server\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of\nthe issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder Calibration\nwindow and EonTimer.\n \n\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my case I just got Timer0'd as the second I hit is equal to my target\nsecond, but the Timer0 is different. I will just continue on doing RNG\nattempts until I hit my target Seed now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got my shiny Terrakion after 8 attempts! If you're on BW1 it's likely\nto take less and if you're on BW2 like I was, it may very well take more\nattempts to get; due to the Timer0's there's unfortunately still always\nluck involved for Gen 5 RNG.\nNext steps...\nAnd with the Static successfully RNGd, we can now save the game.\nAnd that's it; you can now RNG Manipulate for any Static encounter (outside\nof the Roamers) in these games.\nMore guides are in the works but until then thank you for reading and have\nfun RNGing!\n\n\n\n","description":"How to Manip a shiny Static encounter in BW1 & BW2.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/static/","title":"BW/BW2 Static Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/tidsid/":{"body":"Overview\nTo be able to RNG manipulate for Shinies, you need to know both your\nTrainer ID (TID) and Secret ID (SID). The TID you can simply view on\nthe back of your Trainer Card, but the SID is hidden away and not\nvisible to the player in any way.\n\nUnlike prior games from Generations 3 and 4, in Gen 5 you can no\nlonger find out your Secret ID from a randomly encountered shiny or\nreally via any other method in the game. This means that the only ways\nof figuring out your SID are to either hack to view your SID using\nprograms such as PKHeX, or to reset your game and RNG manipulate a\nTID/SID pair at the start of the new game, which is what this guide will\nteach you.\nShould you already have an older save file on your game that you are not\nwilling to delete, do not have access to hacks and still wish to RNG\nmanipulate for shinies in Gen 5, you can use the program Entralinked by\nKuroppoi.\nFollow the Setup Guide, tuck in a Pokémon you caught on your save file\nand you'll be able to view its SID in the user interface of the program.\nIn the past in Generations 3 and 4 there was something called „PID/IV\ncorrelation\", which meant that you could not just get any IV+nature\nspread shiny on any random TID/SID, but you only had at most 1 or 2\nspreads with 5 or 6 perfect IVs that you could get as shinies on\nStationary, Gift or Wild encounters, if any such good ones at all. There\nyou had to RNG manip a TID/SID at the start of your adventure if you\nwanted e.g. a 6IV shiny Dialga. In Gen 5, this is no longer the case\nand every single TID/SID combination can get every possible IV+nature\nspread as a shiny.\nThere's 3 cases in which you should still RNG manip a specific TID/SID\npair though to save yourself from wasting a lot of time and that is\nfor the Starter or Roamer in BW1 and for the Starter in BW2. This is\nonly relevant if you want any of those 3 to have 5 or 6 perfect IVs\nAND be shiny. If you just care for the IVs or just care for\nShininess for the three mentioned cases, but not both combined,\nthere's no point in preparing for it now. Instead you will want\nto do TID/SID RNG just to get a specific ID number like e.g. your\nfavorite number. Most older guides just had you execute this RNG without\ngoing for anything specific and then just take the first TID/SID pair\nthat PokeFinder tells you you supposedly hit, but that often lead to\npeople being unable to get shinies later, as the TID/SID presented by the\nprogram were not what they actually hit. Going for a specific number\nensures that once you do get it, you can be confident it's the correct\none.\nRecommended setup\nHardware requirements\n\n\nA Generation 5 Pokémon game and a DS Console you have calibrated for\nGen 5 RNG Manipulation (if you have not calibrated it yet, go to the\ncalibration guide)\n\n\na Windows 10/11 PC, MacOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nor QT 6.8 or newer\n\n\nIn-Game requirements\n\nDo not have a save file on your game. To delete an old save file press\nUp+Select+B at the title screen and follow the instructions on\nscreen.\n\n\n\n\nTools used\n\n\nPokéFinder version 4.3.1 or newer\nPro tip: You can change the language of PokeFinder under \"Tools\" -&gt; \"Settings\"\nto fit your game's language. This will change the names of the Pokémon,\nlocations, Characteristics and Natures to be that of the game's language, which\nmay be helpful later. For some languages, UI elements are also translated (e.g.\nin German and Italian), but not for all (e.g. Japanese and Korean don't have\nfull UI translation).\n\n\nFor Windows: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.6-calibration-fix\n\n\nFor Mac &amp; Linux: EonTimer\n3.0.0-rc.4\n\n\nVideo example\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nPick your game version\nWhilst the process isn't all that different between BW1 and BW2, there's\nenough smaller differences that warrant having them be in 2 separate\ntabs. Select the Game version you're playing:\nIf you're playing BW1, select the BW1 Tab and if you're playing\nBW2, select the BW2 Tab. I will be using my German copy of Black 1\nand my English copy of Black 2 for this guide.\n\n  BW1\n  BW2\n\nSetup\n\nAs alluded to earlier, in the cases of the Starter and Roamer in BW1,\nyou may want to prepare for those now. If you simply want a shiny\n(possibly with a specific nature) of either of the two or just want them\nto have perfect IVs and a beneficial nature but without being shiny,\nthere's no use in preparing for that now, as it'll be fairly easy to get\nlater on anyways. If you, however, do want 5/6 perfect IVs AND for it to\nbe shiny, you should prepare for that to save yourself many hours of\ntime later. \nThis is important for the Starter, as that early on in the\ngame you lack Chatot which are the primary tool used to advance the RNG\nforward relatively quickly and consistently, and instead you only have\nthe very slow saving the game as a way to advance. So to not have to\nsave the game 500 times wasting 2 hours of your time, you should prepare\na target Seed that has 5/6 perfect IVs on IV Advance 0 with an early PID\nAdvance that has the nature you desire which you can then turn shiny.\n\nNote: Difference between PIDrng Advances and IV Advances \nGeneration 5 uses 2 completely separate RNG algorithms derived from the Initial\nSeed to each decide some of the random things that happen in the game:\nThe first of the two, commonly referred to as the PIDrng, controls\nthe \"regular\" Advances. These Advances decide a wild Pokémons encounter \nslot (so which species of the on a Route available ones you'll battle when \nwalking through grass), its Nature, ability, gender, PID (which decides shininess) \nand whether it's holding an item or not.\nThis PIDrng algorithm is also used by several other things in the game to \ndetermine their random patterns, which also means it is advanced whenever \nthose need to perform a randomized action. Notably this includes \nthe movement of randomly moving NPCs, Rain/Snow/Hail/Sandstorm \npatterns, the game deciding whether you should trigger a wild encounter \nwhen walking throu'gh Tall Grass (/Caveground/Surfing on water etc.), what\nposition the clock's needle should start in when saving the game and \nhow high of a pitch a custom recorded Chatter should have each time you \nview the summary of a Chatot (among many other more minor things).\n\n\n\n\nThe second RNG algorithm, commonly referred to as the IVrng, is used\nfor far fewer things however. It mainly controls what IVs (and with that\nthe Hidden Power type and base power, since that's fully dependent on IVs) \na Pokémon you encounter will have. It also controls the friendship step \ncounter, which activates every 128 steps and has a 50/50 chance to \nincrease each party member's friendship by 1, whether a Pokémon gets \nPokerus after a battle and ALL the randomized actions inside a battle, \nincluding whether a Focus Blast hits or misses or whether a Flamethrower \ngets a burn on the opposing Pokémon. Due to it controlling all random \nactions in battles, it was made to advance at 60 Advances per second \nfor each Pokémon active on the field to make it harder to manipulate \nthe luck in battles.\n\n\n\n\nThe two RNG algorithms being separate also means that, whilst one of the \ntwo can move by hundreds or even thousands of Advances, the other can \nremain at the exact same Advance throughout it all, which is why in these\npictures you see the parts controlled by the PIDrng changing with each\nAdvance, whilst the parts controlled by the IVrng remain the exact same.\nDue to the lack of good and reliable tools for advancing the IVrng, you\nwill later see us always searching for an IVrng Advance of 0 and only ever\nadjusting the PIDrng Advances since those can easily be advanced via e.g.\nChatot.\nAs a side note, the C-Gear is a bit of an odd case here, as it Advances\nboth the PIDrng AND the IVrng whenever it's active. Make sure to always\ndeactivate it when prompted upon loading your save file whilst doing\nRNG Manipulation.\n\nHow to actually RNG manipulate the Starter later I will not explain\nhere but in a specific Starter RNG guide. As for the Roamer you'll\nalso want to prepare for a 5/6 IV shiny now, as it's the single most\nannoyingly inconsistent RNG in all of Gen 5 due to both the random\ninterference from NPCs on Route 7 and the storm cutscene itself\nadvancing the RNG by wildly varying amounts. Going for less than 5/6\nperfect IVs will also actually make this more difficult for reasons I\nwill not explain here; so you must choose between getting a 5/6 IV and\ngetting one with fully random IVs. Due to the scope of the preparations\nneeded for the Roamer, I will not explain how to prepare for it at all\nin this guide to not bloat it with a lot of extra information, but\nrather give Roamer ID preparation its own guide here.\nYou can only prepare for one of the two, the Starter or the Roamer,\non your save file, so choose wisely. To find out how to prepare for\ngetting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter, check out the following note.\n\nNote: Getting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter  \nBefore we continue, we'll want to import an IV Cache into our Profile\nto significantly speed up the target Seed search.\nFor this we need to download the IV Cache first. You can get it from\nthe Assets on PokeFinder's GitHub page.\nI'll pick the 0-5 IV Advance Cache so I'll have more options if I\nwant to do some advanced IV advancement methods in the future (not\ndiscussed in this guide). It also costs less than 1 MB space more than\nthe one with only IV Advance 0, so I don't see a point in ever choosing\nthe Advance 0 file. I\nrecommend you save it in the PokeFinder folder so you can easily find\nit again later. Should you accidentally delete the file you can always\njust redownload it.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the main window of PokeFinder go to Gen 5 Tools at the top, open the\nProfile Manager and once there, select the Profile of the game you wish to\ndo this RNG in and click the edit button at the top.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\nA smaller Profile Editor window will pop up with 2 empty fields in the\nbottom right labeled IV Cache and SHA Cache. Click on the Select File\nbutton next to the IV Cache and PokeFinder will open your file explorer in\nthe folder you saved PokeFinder in.\n\n  \n  \n\nHere select the IV Cache file you downloaded earlier. The SHA Cache you can\nignore for now. It's primarily useful for wild RNG when you're going for\nhighly specific targets and cuts down the search time even further.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow we can continue. To get a Seed to target for your Starter, you'll want\nto start by opening up PokeFinder, going to the Gen 5 tab and once\nthere opening the Static option.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there's 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the RNG Info section, put the Max Advances to 10 and input\na date range you wish to search through (I personally would pick the\nfull current month) leaving the Initial IV Advances and Max IV\nAdvances both at 0. Next in the Settings section, select the \nStarters Category with the Starter you wish to RNG and finally in\nthe Filters section input your desired IVs, Gender and Nature.\nMake sure to NOT search for a shiny here, as the goal is to\nfind a not yet shiny spread that we'll make shiny later.\n\n\n\n\nNow you can hit the Search button. If you get no results you can\neither search through a different date range (e.g. the full next month),\nincrease the Max Advances (don't forget saving the game to advance is\nyour only option and takes quite a while) or select more possible\nKeypresses in your Profile. Once you've found a result you're happy\nwith, copy its PID and write it down somewhere you can find it again\nlater.\n\nNote: How to change Keypresses \nIn the Static window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIf I were to prepare for a Starter, I would take this marked one, as the\nKeypresses are easy and the target second in 21 is very quick (would be\nquite long if you're on a 3DS model but I'm not). Now best to also\ne.g. take a screenshot of the full window to easily be able to find\nthis target Seed again in the future when you get to actually RNG the\nstarter itself. That's all the prep you need, so you can now continue on\nwith the guide.\n\nOpen up PokeFinder, go to the Gen 5 tab and once there, open the\nIDs option.\n\n  \n  \n\nThere select the Profile of the game you wish to do TID/SID RNG in\nif it isn't selected already and in the left half of the window labeled\nSearch By, put the start and end date to however long of a time\nwindow you wish to search through (I'll search through one week\nstarting on the 11th of August 2025 and ending on the 17th) and set the\nMax Advances to 0.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow there's 3 more checkboxes with fields next to them labeled PID,\nTID and SID. The SID field you basically never want to use\nunless you have a HIGHLY specific purpose for it (mainly would be used\nto nickname event Pokémon, as that requires matching TID, SID, trainer\nname, trainer gender and game of origin). The PID field is for when\nyou wish to prepare your save file to easily be able to get e.g.\na 5/6 IV Starter or Roamer and the TID field is for when\nyou wish to get a specific number Trainer ID. Neither of those two are\nrequired but I recommend aiming for a TID number you like, as it does not\naffect the difficulty of the RNG at all. In this example I will check\noff both boxes and input the PID of a 5IV Timid Roamer I prepared for\nand the TID number of 00555 just because I think it's a funny number.\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you wish to get a number that starts with any 0's such as my 00555,\nbe aware that PokeFinder will only let you input the 555, as it has the\nexact same value as 00555; once you successfully RNG it to be your\nsave files TID, it'll show up as 00555 as expected (05050 for example is\ninput as 5050; only 0's at the front of a number, before any not-0\nnumber, can be ignored). The Static/Wild checkbox is required to\ncheck off if you were to prepare for a Stationary or Wild encounters PID\nto turn shiny, but you're probably preparing for either nothing, the\nStarter (Gift encounter) or for the Roamer, so no need to check off\nthat box. Then you can click Search, and if you searched for\nnothing specific at all, or only searched for either a specific TID\nnumber or a specific PID to be turned shiny, but not both, you will most\ndefinitely get several results already.\n\n  \n  \n\nSince I was looking for both a specific TID and a PID, I did not get any\nresults this time and now have 3 options:\n\n\nIncrease the date range I search through. Since I want the\n\"Adventure Started\" date to be close to the actual date, I personally am\nnot willing to increase this.\n\n\nIncrease Max Advances. Whilst Advances will make each attempt take a\nbit longer, even just 5 of them will have PokeFinder search through\nsignificantly more results so I'll put them to 5. I'd say doing up to 20\nis generally within reason. I will explain how to actually do Advances\nlater.\n\n\nIncrease Keypresses in my Profile. I'm already at 0-4 and whilst 5\nis still usually doable. I will keep it at 4 for now and see if just\nincreasing the Max Advances to 5 will give me any results.\n\n\n\nNote: How to change Keypresses \nIn the TID/SID window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nNow searching again with the settings adjusted, PokeFinder found 6\ntarget Seeds I can go for. Since I'm lazy I'll go with the one that\nrequires less work from me. The fifth one has by far the most\ncomfortable target seconds for me to aim for in 24; the others are\neither so low that I'd have to add a full minute to the timer or are\n~30 seconds higher anyways. On 3DS the threshold for what target\nseconds will have you add a minute to the timer is gonna be much lower\nso going for something between like 40-55 target seconds would be most\ncomfortable there. The Seed has Advances of 34 and Initial Advances of\n30 which means that I'd later have to do 34-30=4 manual Advances myself.\nThere's also 2 Keypresses in the Start and Up buttons that I'll have to\npress during startup of the game later.\n\n\nAs alluded to earlier, in the case of the Starter in BW2, you may want\nto prepare for it now. If you simply want a shiny (possibly with a\nspecific nature and gender) or just want it to have perfect IVs and a\nbeneficial nature but without being shiny, there's no use in preparing\nfor that now, as it'll be fairly easy to get later on anyways. If you\nhowever do want 5/6 perfect IVs AND for it to be shiny, you should\nprepare for that to save yourself many hours of time later.\nThis is\nimportant for the Starter, as that early on in the game you lack Chatot\nwhich are the primary tool used to advance the RNG forward relatively\nquickly and consistently, and instead you only have the very slow saving\nthe game as a way to advance. But even that is highly unreliable for the\nStarter, as there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in when you're standing\nin front of Bianca which can and will advance the RNG by inconsistent\namounts between saves. Here you should prepare a target Seed that has\n5/6 perfect IVs on IV Advance 0 with an early PIDrng Advance that has\nthe nature you desire which you can then turn shiny.\n\nNote: Difference between PIDrng Advances and IV Advances \nGeneration 5 uses 2 completely separate RNG algorithms derived from the Initial\nSeed to each decide some of the random things that happen in the game:\nThe first of the two, commonly referred to as the PIDrng, controls\nthe \"regular\" Advances. These Advances decide a wild Pokémons encounter \nslot (so which species of the on a Route available ones you'll battle when \nwalking through grass), its Nature, ability, gender, PID (which decides shininess) \nand whether it's holding an item or not.\nThis PIDrng algorithm is also used by several other things in the game to \ndetermine their random patterns, which also means it is advanced whenever \nthose need to perform a randomized action.

Make sure to always\ndeactivate it when prompted upon loading your save file whilst doing\nRNG Manipulation.\n\nHow to actually RNG manipulate the Starter later I will not explain\nhere but in a specific Starter RNG guide. To find out how to prepare\nfor a 5/6 IV shiny Starter, check out the following note.\n\nNote: Getting a 5/6 IV shiny Starter  \nBefore we continue, we'll want to import an IV Cache into our Profile\nto significantly speed up the target Seed search.\nFor this we need to download the IV Cache first. You can get it from\nthe Assets on PokeFinder's GitHub page.\nI'll pick the 0-5 IV Advance Cache so I'll have more options if I\nwant to do some advanced IV advancement methods in the future (not\ndiscussed in this guide). It also costs less than 1 MB space more than\nthe one with only IV Advance 0, so I don't see a point in ever choosing\nthe Advance 0 file. I\nrecommend you save it in the PokeFinder folder so you can easily find\nit again later. Should you accidentally delete the file you can always\njust redownload it.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the main window of PokeFinder go to Gen 5 Tools at the top, open the\nProfile Manager and once there, select the Profile of the game you wish to\ndo this RNG in and click the edit button at the top.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\nA smaller Profile Editor window will pop up with 2 empty fields in the\nbottom right labeled IV Cache and SHA Cache. Click on the Select File\nbutton next to the IV Cache and PokeFinder will open your file explorer in\nthe folder you saved PokeFinder in.\n\n  \n  \n\nHere select the IV Cache file you downloaded earlier. The SHA Cache you can\nignore for now. It's primarily useful for wild RNG when you're going for\nhighly specific targets and cuts down the search time even further.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow we can continue. To get a Seed to target for your Starter, you'll want\nto start by opening up PokeFinder, going to the Gen 5 tab and once\nthere opening the Static option.\n\n  \n  \n\nIn the Gen 5 Static windows top left make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there's 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the RNG Info section, put the Initial Advances to 4, the\nMax Advances to 0 and input a date range you wish to search\nthrough (I personally would pick the full current month) whilst\nleaving the Initial IV Advances and Max IV Advances both at 0. \n\nNote: Why 4 advances? \nWithout getting too technical, there's 2 randomly moving NPCs loaded in \nwhen taking the starter from Bianca that can already advance the RNG whilst\nthe game is showing you the current season upon loading in. If you're as \nfast as possible, there will be 40 frames (at 30fps) during which the NPCs\ncan advance, and for the specific NPC types that are loaded there, the odds\nof 4 advances happening are ~31.69% whilst all other advance numbers have \nfar lower odds at about 15% or less. For more technical details, check out \nthis Google Sheet.\n\nNext in the\nSettings section, select the Starters Category with the\nStarter you wish to RNG and finally in the Filters section input\nyour desired IVs, Gender and Nature. Make sure to NOT search for a\nshiny here, as the goal is to find a not yet shiny spread that we'll\nmake shiny later.\n\n\n\n\nNow you can hit the Search button. If you get no results you can\neither search through a different date range (e.g. the full next month),\nincrease the Max Advances (don't forget saving the game to advance is\nyour only option and takes quite a while) or select more possible\nKeypresses in your Profile. I do not recommend changing the Advance\nrange at all for BW2, as that'll mean you'll have to rely on the\ninconsistent Advances of the NPCs to get you to your target Advance.\nOnce you've found a result you're happy with, copy its PID and write\nit down somewhere you can find it again later.\n\nNote: How to change Keypresses \nIn the Static window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nI will use this 6 IV Adamant Female Snivy Seed (for which I needed to\nincrease my Keypresses up to 5 at a time to find it). The target second\nis not too bad and Keypresses are fine enough; there's far worse\ncombinations of 5 Keypresses to hold on a DS Phat model. Now best to\nalso e.g. take a screenshot of the full window to easily be able to\nfind this target Seed again in the future when you get to actually RNG\nthe starter itself. That's all the prep you need, so you can now\ncontinue on with the guide.\n\nOpen up PokeFinder, go to the Gen 5 tab and once there, open the\nIDs option.\n\n  \n  \n\nThere select the Profile of the game you wish to do TID/SID RNG in\nif it isn't selected already and in the left half of the window labeled\nSearch By, put the start and end date to however long of a time\nwindow you wish to search through (I'll search through one week\nstarting on the 11th of August 2025 and ending on the 17th) and set the\nMax Advances to 0.\n\n  \n  \n\nNow there's 3 more checkboxes with fields next to them labeled PID,\nTID and SID. The SID field you basically never want to use\nunless you have a HIGHLY specific purpose for it (mainly would be used\nto nickname event Pokémon, as that requires matching TID, SID, trainer\nname, trainer gender and game of origin). \nThe PID field is for when\nyou wish to prepare your save file to easily be able to get e.g.\na 5/6 IV Starter and the TID field is for when you wish to\nget a specific number Trainer ID. Neither of those two are required\nbut in this example I will check off both boxes inputting the PID of the\n6IV Adamant Starter I prepared and the TID number of 55000 just because\nI think it's a funny number.\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you wish to get a number that starts with any 0's such as 00555, be\naware that PokeFinder will only let you input the 555, as it has the\nexact same value as 00555; once you successfully RNG it to be your\nsave files TID, it'll show up as 00555 as expected (05050 for example is\ninput as 5050; only 0's at the front of a number before any not-0 number\ncan be ignored). \nThe Static/Wild checkbox is required to check off\nif you were to prepare for a Stationary or Wild encounters PID to turn\nshiny, but you're probably preparing for either nothing or the Starter\n(Gift encounter), so no need to check off that box. Then you can\nclick Search, and if you searched for nothing specific at all, or only\nsearched for either a specific TID number or a specific PID to be turned\nshiny, but not both, you will most definitely get several results\nalready. But if for example you search for both a TID and a PID, you may\nnot have gotten any results right now in which case you have 3 options:\n1. Increase the date range you search through.\n2. Increase Max Advances. Whilst Advances will make each attempt take a\nbit longer, even just 5 of them will have PokeFinder search through\nsignificantly more results so I'll put them to 5. I'd say doing up to 10\nis generally within reason. I will explain how to actually do Advances\nlater.\n3. Increase Keypresses in your Profile. I'm already at 0-4 but 5 is\nstill usually doable just fine whilst 6, 7 or 8 are sometimes not\nhumanly feasible.\n\nNote: How to change Keypresses \nIn the TID/SID window click on the Manager button in the top left and the\nProfile Manager will open. Select the Profile of the game you're RNGing\nin and click on the Edit button at the top to open the Profile Editor.\nHere you can change the active Keypresses. Make sure to click the Accept\nbutton after to save your changes.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nNow with at least one target Seed found, you must choose which to pick.\nGenerally I recommend to prioritize aiming for something with a low\ntarget second so like 16-31 on DS/Lite/i and 40-55 on 3DS models. In my\ncase I only got a single one so I have no choice but to take it (or\nsearch another date range/more Advances/add more Keypresses). \nSince I\nput the Max Advances to 0, I'll not have to advance at all myself but if\nyou did have to increase the Max Advances, the amount of Advances you\nhave to do yourself is calculated by subtracting the Initial Advances\nfrom the Advances. If the Initial Advances were 30 for example and the\nAdvances were 34, I'd later have to do 34-30=4 manual Advances myself.\nThere's also 2 Keypresses in the B and Start buttons that I'll have to\npress during startup of the game later.\n\nThe RNG process\n\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seeds\nseconds (24 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date to\nthe target date (here the 12th of August 2025) and get ready to\nchange and confirm the target time (16:07 for me; should EonTimer say\n\"Minutes Before Target: 1\" and your target time is e.g. 12:30:05,\nyou'd need to put it to 12:29 in your DS).\n\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu, get\nready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer\nsounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons your target Seed\nmay require (start pressing the buttons right after you started the\ngame and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will\nneed to press and hold the Start button and the Up direction on the\nD-pad).\n\nNow continue on selecting the \"NEW GAME\" option, go through the\nintroduction sequence, choose your gender and name yourself. After\nconfirming your name on the bottom screen by clicking on OK, Professor\nJuniper will ask you whether she got your name right and this is the\nmoment you can Advance the RNG if your target ID pair requires any\nAdvances.\n\nIn my case I will need to do 4 Advances, so I say \"No\" to her question a\ntotal of 4 times. Each time you say \"No\" when Juniper asks you this,\nthe RNG Advances by 1, so do this however often is required for your\ntarget ID pair. After you're done with advancing you can finish up the\nintroduction and get through the conversation with Cheren and Bianca.\nRight after, as soon as you can move your character, open up the\nmenu by pressing X, go to the trainer info option (will just be named\nwhatever you named yourself; has a yellow card symbol), click on the\ntrainer card symbol in the bottom left and flip the card on its back\nusing the flip  button to\nsee what TID you got. If you got your target TID number: \nCongratulations! You just successfully RNG manipulated your\nTID/SID and can now skip to the \"Next Steps...\"\nsection.\n\n\nOpen up EonTimer and there put the Target Second to your Seeds\nseconds (6 in my case), go into the DS menu to change the date to\nthe target date (here the 12th of August 2025) and get ready to\nchange and confirm the target time (normally it'd be 02:49 for me with\nthat target Seed, however EonTimer says \"Minutes Before Target: 1\"\nso I need to put the time to a minute earlier in 02:48 on my DS; this is\ndue to 6 being too low of a target second to feasibly hit, so EonTimer\nadds a full minute to the time).\n\n\n\n  DS\n  DSi\n  3DS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu, get\nready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer\nsounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons your target Seed\nmay require (start pressing the buttons right after you started the\ngame and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will\nneed to press and hold the B and Start buttons).\n\nNow continue on selecting the \"NEW GAME\" option, go through the\nintroduction sequence, choose your gender and name yourself. After\nconfirming your name on the bottom screen by clicking on OK, Professor\nJuniper will ask you whether she got your name right and this is the\nmoment you can Advance the RNG if your target ID pair requires any\nAdvances.\n\nIn my case I don't need to do any Advances but if you had to do e.g. 4\nAdvances, you'd say \"No\" to her question a total of 4 times. Each time\nyou say \"No\" when Juniper asks you this, the RNG Advances by 1, so do\nthis however often is required for your target ID pair. You also get to\nname your rival in these games but saying \"No\" to Juniper when she asks\nyou whether she got his name correct will not advance the RNG. \nAfter\nyou're done with advancing you can finish up the introduction and as\nsoon as you can move your character, open up the menu by pressing X,\ngo to the trainer card option (will just be named whatever you named\nyourself; has a yellow card symbol) and flip the card on its back using\nthe flip  button to\nsee what TID you got. If you got your target TID number: \nCongratulations! You just successfully RNG manipulated your\nTID/SID and can now skip to the \"Next Steps...\"\nsection.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf this is not your target TID number however, you first gotta find out\nwhat else you may have hit to make sure nothing else went wrong. Start\nby opening the Profile Manager at the top. Here create a new\nProfile that is an exact copy of the Profile of the game that you have\nbeen using for this IDrng as of yet, but with one difference: for\nthe Min and Max Timer0, input both Timer0 values that you can get\nhere. I for example can get both C78 and C79 as my Timer0's, so I'll\nput the Min to the lower value of the two in C78 and the Max to the\nhigher value in C79. If you don't know your other, less common Timer0\nvalue, just put the range to include both the Timer0 above and the\nTimer0 below your main one (in my case that would be C78 below and C7A\nabove my main C79), as that'll make the program search all three\nTimer0's. I'll name this new Profile \"B1 Phat Troubleshooting\" since\nit's for troubleshooting my Black 1 game that I RNG with on my \"Phat\" DS.\n\n  \n  \n\nThis Profile will ONLY be for troubleshooting. Whenever you search\nfor a target Seed, you should always select your main Profile.\nSave the Profile, go back to the IDs window, select this newly\ncreated Profile and now input the TID you got into the right half of\nPokeFinder's IDrng section labeled \"Seed Finder\", put the\ndate, hour and minute to that of your target Seed, the\nSecond Range to be +/-1 of your target second if you're on\nDS/Lite/i and +/-3 if you're on 3DS models (so 23-25 for me since\nmy target is 24 and I'm on a DS) and put the Max Advances to the\namount you need to do +1 (so 4+1=5 in my case). Now press the Find\nbutton and you should be presented with at least 1 result.\n\n  \n  \n\nIf there's nothing that likely means you did something wrong. Double\ncheck all the date and time settings match in both PokeFinder and on\nyour DS. After you checked simply try again, whether you noticed\nsomething or not, and if you still get nothing, calibrate your Profile\none more attempt to make sure you didn't accidentally write down the\nwrong VCount or something. If after all that you still cannot seem to\nget anything, join im a blisy ._.'s RNG manip assistance Discord\nserver and ask for help in the\nbw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of the issue and full\nwindow screenshots of your PokéFinder IDs window and EonTimer.\nIf you do get a result, you now need to check whether it's sensible by\nhaving a look at the Advances. Optimally whatever you hit should have\nthe exact same Keypresses your target ID has and the difference between\nthe Advances and the Initial Advances columns should match the amount of\nmanual Advances you did, but since we're all only human and can e.g.\nmiscount, if it's 1 Advance too much or 1 too little it's likely still\nvalid. Also have a look at the second you hit vs the second you\ntargeted. Normally on DS, Lite and i you should always hit your exact\ntarget second whilst on 3DS models hitting 1 off is fairly common. If\nthe result is off any more than that, do 1 more\nProfile Calibration and adjust your EonTimer\nwith the second you hit instead of your target if needed.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my first attempt I hit a TID of 16293 which I get 2 results for. I\nknow the second one is the one I hit because the Keypresses match and\n36-32=4 which matches the amount of Advances I did precisely as well.\nThe second I hit is also 24 just like my target but the Timer0 I hit is\nmy rarer Timer0 in C78 instead of my target C79. That'll just happen\nsometimes; nothing I can do about that except try again and hope I won't\nget Timer0'd again. \nWhilst in theory this is a valid hit, and if\nI didn't care for my TID to be 00555 specifically (and didn't want a\n5/6IV shiny Starter or Roamer), I could just proceed now being done\nwith TID/SID RNG, I would advise against it. The amount of times I've\nseen people who thought they got an ID pair just because PokeFinder\ndisplayed it to them when in reality something went wrong making them\nunable to get e.g. a shiny Starter later is in the dozens. \nI ALWAYS\nrecommend people to continue until they get the specific TID/SID pair\nthey originally aimed for. That is the only way to ensure you did\nindeed get what PokeFinder tells you you got and with IDrng being one of\nthe easiest RNGs in Gen 5 it's not gonna take particularly long or be\nvery difficult to successfully do either. So now you just rinse and\nrepeat this RNG until you get your desired ID pair.\n\n\nIf this is not your target TID number however, you first gotta find out\nwhat else you may have hit to make sure nothing else went wrong. Start\nby opening the Profile Manager at the top. Here create a new\nProfile that is an exact copy of the Profile that you have\nbeen using for this IDrng as of yet, but with one difference: for\nthe Min and Max Timer0, check out what Timer0's you have gotten\nduring Profile calibration and input the lowest value -1 as the Min and\nthe highest value +1 as the Max (if you got e.g. 1102, 1103, 1104,\n1105, 1106, 1107, 1108 and 1109 as Timer0's, put the range to 1101-110A).\nIf you did not write down all the Timer0's you can get or lost the writeup,\nput the range to your most common Timer0 -A and +A. You can use the\nfollowing input field to calculate this new Profiles Min and Max Timer0\nbased on your most common Timer0, if you don't know your full range.\n\n  \n  Timer0 Min: 0\n  Timer0 Max: 0\n\nThis will give you a\nlarger Timer0 range than you can actually hit, thus making you get more\ninvalid results than otherwise, but it's still going to be very helpful\nin determining what you hit. Just not quite as efficient as knowing your\nactual Timer0 range would be. If I didn't know my full range already, I'd\njust input 1106 for example, as that is my most common Timer0, and this\ncalculator would return me 10FC as the Min and 1110 as the Max.\nI'll name this new Profile \"B2 Phat Eng Troubleshooting\" since it's for\ntroubleshooting my English Black 2 game that I RNG with on my DS (If\nyou are using one of the DSi/3DS consoles that can have 2 different\nVCounts, you'll need to make 2 of these Profiles each having 1 of\nthe two VCounts you can get).\n\n  \n  \n\nThis Profile will ONLY be for troubleshooting. Whenever you search\nfor a target Seed, you should always select your main Profile.\nSave the Profile, go back to the IDs window, select this newly\ncreated Profile and now input the TID you got into the right half of\nPokeFinder's IDrng section labeled \"Seed Finder\", put the\ndate, hour and minute to that of your target Seed, the\nSecond Range to be +/-1 of your target second if you're on\nDS/Lite/i and +/-3 if you're on 3DS models (so 5-7 for me since my\ntarget is 6 and I'm on a DS) and put the Max Advances to the amount\nyou need to do +1 (so 0+1=1 in my case). Now press the Find button\nand you should be presented with at least 1 result.\n\n  \n  \n\nIf there's nothing that likely means you did something wrong. Double\ncheck all the date and time settings match in both PokeFinder and on\nyour DS. After you checked simply try again, whether you noticed\nsomething or not, and if you still get nothing, calibrate your Profile\none more attempt to make sure you didn't accidentally write down the\nwrong VCount or something. If after all that you still cannot seem to\nget anything, join im a blisy ._.'s RNG manip assistance Discord\nserver\nand ask for help in the bw_b2w2 channel providing an explanation of\nthe issue and full window screenshots of your PokéFinder IDs window and\nEonTimer.\nIf you do get a result, you now need to check whether it's sensible by\nhaving a look at the Advances. Optimally whatever you hit should have\nthe exact same Keypresses your target ID has and the difference between\nthe Advances and the Initial Advances columns should match the amount of\nmanual Advances you did, but since we're all only human and can e.g.\nmiscount, if it's 1 Advance too much or 1 too little it's likely still\nvalid.

If\nthe result is off any more than that, do 1 more\nProfile Calibration and adjust your EonTimer\nwith the second you hit instead of your target if needed.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIn my first attempt I hit a TID of 21775 which I get 2 results for. I\nknow the first one is the one I hit because the Keypresses match and\n36-36=0 which matches the amount of Advances I did precisely as well.\nThe second I hit is also 6 just like my target but the Timer0 I hit is\n1107 instead of my target 1106. That'll just happen a fair lot in BW2;\nnothing I can do about that except try again and hope I won't get\nTimer0'd too much. Whilst in theory this is a valid hit and if I\ndidn't care for my TID to be 55000 specifically (and didn't want a 5/6IV\nshiny Starter) I could just proceed now being done with TID/SID RNG, I\nwould advise against it. \nThe amount of times I've seen people who\nthought they got an ID pair just because PokeFinder displayed it to them\nwhen in reality something went wrong making them unable to get e.g. a\nshiny Starter later is in the dozens. I ALWAYS recommend people to\ncontinue until they get the specific TID/SID pair they originally aimed\nfor. That is the only way to ensure you did indeed get what PokeFinder\ntells you you got and with IDrng being one of the easiest RNGs in BW2\nit's not gonna take particularly long or be very difficult to\nsuccessfully do either in comparison to other BW2 RNGs. So now you just\nrinse and repeat this RNG until you get your desired ID pair; due to\nthe volatility of the Timer0 in BW2 it's not unlikely you'll have to do\n10 or more attempts depending on your luck (also will be more on 3DS\nmodels due to the inconsistency with the seconds you hit).\n\nUpdating the Profile\n\n\nI got my wanted TID of 00555 on the second try already! Now all that's\nleft to do is go to the Profile Manager at the top left of the IDs\nwindow and edit our main Profile by inputting the TID/SID pair we got.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nAfter 7 attempts, I got my target ID of 55000! Now all that's left to do\nis go to the Profile Manager at the top left of the IDs window and edit\nour main Profile by inputting the TID/SID pair we got.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nFinally click on Accept to save the changes.\nNext steps...\nAnd with our TID/SID successfully RNGd, we can now save the\ngame. And that's it; now you can continue your RNG journey and\nmanipulate yourself some shinies! If you'd like to RNG a shiny Starter,\ncheck out this guide if you're on BW1 or this\nguide if you're on BW2.\nThank you for reading and have fun RNGing!\n\n\n","description":"How to RNG Manip a TID/SID combo for shinies later.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/beginner/tidsid/","title":"BW/BW2 Trainer ID & Secret ID Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/extra credit/":{"body":"","description":"Toughest Manips Available","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/extra credit/","title":"Extra Credit"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/extra credit/roamer/":{"body":"Overview\nThis is a much more complex RNG to prepare for than the Starter, but it\nmay be worth it, as this is the only way to get a perfect IV shiny\nTornadus or Thundurus in Gen 5.\nThere are 2 different ways you could prepare for it: the Safe way and\nthe Risky way.\nThe Safe way involves playing through the game once up until you beat\nthe 8th gym, after which you can first summon Tornadus/Thundurus. Here\nyou would RNG it in a specific way only for IVs &amp; nature, not yet for\nshininess, to find an RNG Advance you can hit consistently that will\nproduce your desired IVs + nature combo. You'll then write down the\nPID of that RNG Advance, delete your current save file and use that PID\nto RNG for a TID/SID that'll make the PID be shiny on your next\nplaythrough. It is quite a large time investment.\nThe Risky way on the other hand works very similar to how preparation\nfor the Starter does, however what makes it so Risky here is that some\nAdvances are completely unreachable when doing Roamer RNG specifically,\nand you can never know which Advances those are until you actually do the\nRoamer RNG. This can potentially lead to you trying out dozens of different\nAdvances on several different target Seeds and still never getting your\nshiny.\nWhichever you want to use is up to you, but my personal recommendation is\nto go with the Safe way. Whilst the Risky way can be much faster than the\nSafe way if you're lucky, it can also be much worse if you're unlucky. And\neven if the time spent later would be about the same on average, during the\nSafe way you would at least have fun playing through the game instead of\ntrying to stop at dozens of different Advances and never hitting your target\nSafe way or Risky way\nshiny advance even after hours of trying.\nSelect the tab of the way you wish to use:\n\n  Safe way\n  Risky way\n\nSetup\n\nTo start the Safe way, you'll want to open up PokeFinder, go to the\nGen 5 tab and once there open the Static option.\n\nIn the Gen 5 Static window's top left, make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there are 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\nIn the RNG Info section put the Initial Advances to 1715 if\nyou're on Black 1 or to 420 if you're on White 1 (I use\nBlack 1 for this example), put the Max Advances to 20 and input a\ndate range you wish to search through (I personally would pick the\nfull current month) whilst leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV\nAdvances and Lucky Power all at 0.\nNext in the Settings section,\nselect the Roamers Category which will automatically select your\nversion's Roamer and finally in the Filters section input your\ndesired IVs, Hidden Power (which fully depends on IVs Hidden Power\nIV Combinations. | Smogon\nForums)\nand nature. Do not search for a Shiny, but just leave that\noption at \"any\", as you're trying to find a not-shiny Advance that\nyou can later turn shiny with a TID/SID combination.\n\nThe Initial Advances sit at those oddly specific seeming numbers because\nRoute 7 can have different weather on it depending on the season and\nprecise date (Clear weather which is just the absence of any of the\nthree following weathers, Rain, Hail or Snow). When you exit the house\non Route 7 to start the Roamer cutscene, whichever weather there is on\nyour current target date will appear until Tornadus/Thundurus descends\nfrom the sky. Rain, Hail and Snow all advance the RNG forward fairly\nquickly at different speeds making you hit a far later Advance than if\nthe weather was Clear. \nNow you'd think why don't we just pick a target\ndate with Clear weather then and for White 1 and Thundurus you'd be\nright as Clear is the optimal weather, however if you're going for\nTornadus in Black 1 you actually want it to specifically Rain\nbeforehand. This is because, for some unknown reason, the Rain Cutscene\nthat Tornadus summons will sometimes extend way past its usual duration\nand make you hit an Advance several dozen to even 200-300 Advances later\nthan expected. This phenomenon happens by far the least often when it\nalready rained on the route just before Tornadus descends from the sky.\nSo for Tornadus you want a Rainy day, which on average Advances\nby around 1705 between you exiting the house and Tornadus generating,\nwhilst for Thundurus you want a target date on a Clear day,\nwhich on average Advances by around 410 between you exiting the house\nand Thundurus generating. You should start searching at 1715/420 with 20\nMax Advances (the Max Advances start counting from the Initial Advances\nmaking the range it searches 1715-1735/420-440) instead of 1705/410 to\nhave at least 10 Advances to confirm the Seed you're on using\nChatot/saving and then be able to find the nature you want by stopping\non an Advance not too far away (20 at most in this case). Which days of\nwhat seasons it Rains, Snows and Hails on at Route 7 you can see in this\ntable (for some reason only Winter months have variation):\n\nSeasons cycle through three times per year. So January is Spring,\nFebruary Summer, March Autumn, April Winter and then in May it goes back\nto Spring etc. (Data from the Bulbapedias Rain and Hail articles\nRain - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia,\nHail (weather condition) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia).\nSince Summer has the by far most Clear days and Spring and Autumn have\nthe by far most Rainy days, I recommend to search through any 1\nfull Spring or Autumn month of your choice for Tornadus or any 1\nfull Summer month of your choice for Thundurus.\nWith all the fields now filled out, press search. \nIf you get no\nresults you can either search through another month, increase Max\nAdvances (will make each attempt take longer later and since you'll most\nlikely have to do this several times, I'd not recommend it) or enable\nmore Keypresses in your Profile (I recommend to have at least none, 1, 2\nand 3 Keypresses enabled and maybe even 4 and 5 too. But no more than 5\nunless you have more than 10 fingers lol; you may need to search through\nseveral months before finding a suitable target Seed when looking for 6\nspecific IVs as it's pretty rare. With only 5 specific IVs and up to 5\nKeypresses, a single month should likely produce several results\nthough).\nWith a few results found to make it much easier to hit the desired\nnature later, there's several more things to account for. Start by\nlooking for a cluster of 2 or more different Advances that all\nhappen on the same Seed.\n\nNext up you'll want to have a look at each of those 2+ Advances'\nCharacteristics.\n\nThey must be different for you to later be able to tell exactly what\nAdvance you hit. If you get the same Characteristic on two or more\ndifferent Advances, those Advances no longer count towards the 2+\nrequired different ones (so if there's 4 Advances on the same Seed where\nthe first one is 'Mischievous', the second 'Alert to sounds', the third\n'Capable of taking hits' and the fourth 'Alert to sounds' again, that\nSeed would only count as having 2 different Advances, as the first and\nthird ones are indistinguishable from each other for us later). \nFrom a\nfew test searches it seems that getting more than 2 properly different\nones (with different and not repeated Characteristics) is fairly rare\n(or extremely rare if you're looking for a 6IV target instead of a 5IV\nlike I did in this example), so if you can only find ones with 2 in a\nrow you can either just take it and hope you can hit either of the two,\nor what I would rather recommend search through a few different months\nto try and find one with 3 (or more; but 3 is good already) as that will\nmake hitting one of the desired nature Advances likely a fair lot\nfaster. This is also why going for less than 5/6 perfect IVs is more\ndifficult here; will give you less different Characteristics.\n\nNote: Read this if you're going for a specific Hidden Power \nSome Hidden Power types make this more restricted. Hidden Power Flying\nfor example only lets you have 1 or 2 of the same equally highest IV\nstat, giving you no option to go for 3 or more different\nCharacteristics. So if you e.g. want a Hidden Power Flying shiny\nThundurus, it will be a bit more tedious to prepare for.\n\nAfter that make sure the Seed is on a date with the recommended\nweather (which mine is as the 4th of July is a Rainy Autumn day).\n\nTo finish up the target Seed selection, you also need to check the\nspecific time of the Seed. This is because after you RNG the Roamer,\nit'll start wandering through the region, and where exactly it goes\ndepends on your current time of day and the season (Roaming\nPokémon,\nTime - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia).\n\n\nSince after the 8th gym you do not yet have access to Routes 11, 12, 13,\n14 and 15, you will want to make sure that either your target Seed is\nnot in the early morning hours or that you remember to beat Ghetsis\nfirst and explore some of the east of Unova before starting the actual\nin-game testing phase of this preparation (the late evening is fine as\nyou can just go back and forth between routes until it is on Routes 9 or\n10 and not 11). For my Black Version Tornadus RNG I will choose the\nshown 5IV, 25 Attack Seed on the 4th of July 2025, at 21:53:36 with the\nKeypresses R + L + B + Left that has 3 different Timid nature Advances\non 1772, 1773 and 1777 all with different Characteristics.\nWith a proper target Seed selected, save its info somewhere (e.g. in\nthe form of a screenshot of the searcher window) and then we can finally\nget into how to actually execute this Safe way. Here you will want to\nbasically speedrun the game (not literally; just be fast to not\nwaste your own time) without doing any RNG at all (again to not waste\ntime) until you can summon the Roamer after the 8th gym. Once\nyou try to go to Route 10 after beating the Opelucid Gym, the worker\ninside the Gate will stop you and tell you about a storm. This means\nthat Tornadus/Thundurus is now available for encountering on Route 7.\nDon't go there just yet though, as there's a few more things to do\nbefore starting. Having at least 1, but preferably 2 Chatot and a\nMaster Ball will make this a fair lot easier and faster but are\nnot absolutely required. \nYou can get Chatot either via trading\nlocally from another Gen 5 game you or a friend may have, from trading\nonline via fan hosted servers (Poké Classic\nNetwork) or by putting some into\nyour Entree Forest using the program \"Entralinked\" mentioned at the\nbeginning of this guide (technically only legal in BW1 as the Dream\nWorld could not spawn Chatot for connected BW2 games originally).\nAnother thing to watch out for is in regards to the in-game\nseason. The Game only updates your current season whenever you leave a\nbuilding or cave, or when crossing between two outdoor maps at a\ntransition that involves a loading zone (such as by moving between the\nvarious sections of Castelia City). The game also remembers what\nyour season was when you last saved. This can become an issue since\nthe process of doing Roamer RNG involves exiting the house on Route 7 on\na certain Advance after which a cutscene will take over immediately and\nsince you are exiting a building, the game will update the current\nseason up to 3 times (depending on both the season you saved in and the\nseason of your target date) during which the two randomly moving NPCs on\nthe Route can already advance the RNG adding more inconsistency to an\nalready inconsistent RNG. \nSo to minimize the NPC issue, you need to\nchange your current season to your target season (if it isn't the same\nalready) by e.g. putting your console date to your target date, loading\nthe game, going into some building or cave, leaving it and then watching\nas the season gets updated.\n\nAfter that you can finally go into the house on Route 7 (make sure\nto bring your Chatot with you if you have any and optimally leave 1\nempty space in your party) and once inside save the game.\nNow back to PokeFinder, open the Gen 5 Static option and select\nyour game's Profile if it isn't already. Paste your target Seed\ninto the Generators Seed field (if you have not closed\nPokeFinder since you found your target Seed, you'll need to switch to\nthe Generator in the top left), put the Max Advances to 30, select\nthe Roamers Category and press the Generate button.\n\nTesting Process\nOpen up EonTimer and put the Target Second to that of your target\nSeed (in my case it's 36 as my target time is 21:53:36; your\ncalibration value you should already have found during Profile\ncalibration).\n\nThen go to the menu of your DS to change the date to that of your\ntarget Seed and get ready to change the time to the proper one as\nwell (if EonTimer says you need to set the time to 1 minute before\ntarget, put it 1 minute earlier than usual so if your target time was\n12:30:05 and EonTimer says \"Minutes Before Target: 1\", put it to\n12:29 in your DS).\n\nDS\n \n \nDSi\n \n\n \n3DS\n \n \n\nAt the moment that you confirm the time change on your DS console,\npress the Start button in EonTimer. Now go back to the home menu, get\nready to start the game as soon as the 6th and final beep of EonTimer\nsounds and make sure to press and hold any buttons your target Seed\nmay require (start pressing the buttons right after you started the\ngame and you can let go once the star appears on the top screen; I will\nneed to press and hold the R, L and B buttons and the Left direction on\nthe D-pad).\n\nThe moment you see this star, you can continue to get into the game.\nJust before you can get in, the C-Gear popup will appear and you\nmust deactivate it upon entering the game as it would otherwise\nscrew with the RNG.\nOnce in-game, open your party and listen to 10 Chatot cries in a row\ncomparing what you hear to what each Advance in PokeFinder shows.\n\nNote: How does using Chatter or saving to advance the RNG work?  \nThe\nway the Chatter works is that you first have to use Chatter as a field\nmove and can then record a custom sound onto it; Chatot learns Chatter\nat level 21. With such a custom Chatter recorded, whenever you view the\nsummary of a Chatot, the game picks a value between 0-99 at random\n(which is why it Advances the RNG forward by 1 each time) and depending\non how high of a number it rolls, the Chatter will sound anywhere from\nvery deep (lower value) to very high (higher value).\n\nIn my case the first Advance on my Seed, Advance 49 (likely a different\nnumber for you), is pretty high with a value of 84 and the Advance\nnumber 50 after has an even higher Chatter with a value of 98 (the\nletters H, MH, M, ML and L stand for High, Medium High, Medium, Medium\nLow and Low). Generally we humans can not differentiate between close by\nvalues like my Advances 51 and 52 which have values of 61 and 56.\nInstead you should try to focus on whether a Chatter sounds more high or\nmore low and then try to orient yourself mostly on pretty low (0-20) and\npretty high (80-99) Chatters. \n\nIn my example the Chatters between\nAdvances 49-58 have values of 84, 98, 61, 56, 29, 37, 81, 5, 66, and 0\nso I know that the first Chatter will sound pretty high, the second one\neven higher, third, and fourth lower than the two before, but still a bit\nhigh, fifth and sixth both a bit lower than before again, the seventh\npretty high, the eighth very low, the ninth a fair bit higher again and\nthe tenth extremely low. The following GIF shows me flipping back and\nforth between 2 Chatot 4 times to advance the RNG by 5 (+1 for opening the\nsummary initially and +4 due to the 4 flips). If you only have 1 Chatot,\nyou can just flip back and forth between it and another party member, but\nofc that'll halve the advancement speed since only viewing Chatot's\nsummary will advance the RNG.\n\nIf you do not have Chatot, you can also use saving the game to advance\nthe RNG (though it is significantly slower). Here is a table of what\nChatter value corresponds to which save needle starting position:\n\nThe edge cases between 2 save needle starting positions can always be\neither one of the two adjacent ones; probably due to some rounding the\ngame does (e.g. 12 and 13 can be either a ↑ or a ↗).\nIn my case, since the very first Advance shown has a value of 84 in the\nChatot column, the save needle would start in a left ← facing position\nwhen saving the game (see GIF).\n\nIf your DS does not seem to pick up any sound you can either use a\ndifferent DS to record a Chatter if you have another one or use save\nneedles to confirm your Seed; even if no sound plays the Chatter will\nstill advance the RNG, but it wouldn't be very helpful to us as we have\nno way of knowing how high or low of a pitch each Chatter was. The\nChatter sound gets deleted whenever you deposit the last Chatot that was\nstill in your party into your boxes.\n\n\nHere's what the first 10 Chatot of my target Seed sounded like (will\nsound different depending on what you recorded. This is just an example;\nwith the Route 7 music in the Background since you can't turn it off):\n\n\n  \nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nIf the Chatters (/save needles) do not seem to line up at all, simply\ntry again beginning with changing the time back to the target value and\nstarting EonTimer. If on a second attempt it also does not seem to\nmatch, double check all date and time settings match your target, make\nsure you accounted for any minutes before target if EonTimer tells you\nyou need them and check if all the buttons you may need to press and\nhold are working properly. If you find nothing wrong, try a third time\nand if it still doesn't match, do 1 Profile calibration run with this\ntarget date, time and Keypresses (only works with up to 3 Keypresses. If\nyou have more just leave as many out as needed until there's only 3\nleft) to check whether you're at least just getting Timer0'd (aka the\ngame is only giving you your usually rarer Timer0) or whether something\nelse is wrong. If you get a valid result that looks like your usual\ncalibration (possibly with the Timer0 being slightly different by 1 hex\nvalue), you're just getting Timer0'd and have the choice between either\ncontinuing to try, as you will get it eventually or trying out another\ntarget Seed hoping that one will be more merciful with the Timer0 (I\nwould probably do ~5 more attempts and if you still couldn't hit it I'd\nrecommend trying another Seed as some date/time/Keypress combinations\nmay have your usually less common Timer0 be much more common making this\nRNG take much longer than normal).\nAfter having done these 10 Advances and being sure you're on the\nright Seed, you can continue advancing towards your target if need\nbe. Take any of the 2-5 Advances with your desired nature (in my\ncase I'll pick the 1773 one as having some desired Advances above at\n1777 and below at 1772 would make it a bit more likely to hit one of\nthem) and subtract 1705 from it if you're on Black 1 or 410 if\nyou're on White 1. In my case this gets me to Advance 1773-1705=68\nso that's the Advance I'll want to stop on on this first attempt. I\ndo the remaining Chatot until I hear the Chatter of Advance 68\n(following along each Advance's Chatter pitch one by one to not lose\ntrack) and then exit the house. Right after exiting the house, the\ncutscene will begin. \nOnce Tornadus/Thundurus descends from the sky,\nstart spamming A, as you spamming it is the by far easiest way to make\nsure your timing on when you close the 2 textboxes that will appear\nis consistent and consistency is key. The first textbox is just\nthe Pokémons scream and the second textbox has 2 parts to it saying\nsomething about the storm. Once that second textbox is gone and\nTornadus/Thundurus has flown away, you can stop spamming the A button.\nThe Storm will last a few seconds longer, and after it stops, you can go\nand hunt down Tornadus/Thundurus (remember that where it appears depends\non your current time of day and to a lesser extent season). The in my\nopinion best way to get it is to just go to the gate adjacent to a Route\nTornadus/Thundurus can be on at your current time of day and then just\ngo back and forth between the Route and Gate until the Storm appears\n(since it's around 22:00 in-game for me, it can appear on Routes 9, 10\nand 11 and I will be in the gate at Route 9).\n\nOnce the Storm is on the Route, run around in the grass until you\nencounter Tornadus/Thundurus (having a repel active with a Pokémon\nthat's very close in level, but not higher than Tornadus/Thundurus (which\nare at level 40), at the front of your party will make this faster). Now\ncatch it (with e.g. a Master Ball) and have a look at its nature\nand Characteristic.\n\nExcuse the German, but in my case I got a Bold nature (Kühn in german)\nand its Characteristic is \"Alert to sounds\" (Achtet auf Geräusche in\ngerman).\n\nNote: natures and Characteristics in other languages  \nYou can change\nthe language of PokeFinder to whatever language your game is in by going\nto Tools and then Settings and it'll display that language's names for\nall the natures and Characteristics.\n\nThat is of course not what I wanted, but that's ok and to be expected due to\nthe inconsistency of this RNG. We want to repeat this as often as\nnecessary until we hit the nature that we want our Tornadus/Thundurus\nto have later on (with a not repeated Characteristic). Trying to stop\non the exact same Advance multiple times is completely useless as\nthat'll always yield the exact same Advance you hit assuming you spammed\nA consistently throughout the cutscene textboxes. Instead you'll want to\ntry the +/-10 surrounding Advances in any order of your liking.\nSince I started at 68, I'll try stopping on 69 next, then 67, 70, 66\netc. always going 1 more Advance up and then 1 more Advance down until I\nget my desired Timid nature. \nWhat else you hit instead of your desired\nnature also doesn't matter so if it's not the correct one you can just\nimmediately go back to the console's date and time settings to try\nagain; do make sure to write down which Advances you tried already\nthough to not waste time trying the same ones several times on accident.\nIt'll probably take around 5-15 attempts, but it can be more or less\ndepending on your luck and if you have incredibly awful luck, all 2-5 of\nthe Advances with your desired nature may be impossible to hit. After\nhaving tried the +/-10 Advances if you did not get your desired nature\nyet, try another 5 in both directions. If you still didn't get it, it's\nprobably best to try another target Seed (in the same season).\n\nI got one of my Seeds Timid Advances after 11 attempts which is fairly\nlucky. I stopped on Advance 63 that attempt and got the one on\n1772. I know that's the one, because it was the only one that's nearby\nwith a Timid nature and Often dozes off as the Characteristics.\n\nNote: The Characteristics of your Pokémon are not in PokeFinder? \nFor English language games, the names of 2 of the Characteristics were\nchanged in Gen 6. Currently PokeFinder only uses the Gen 6+ names for\nthese, even for older generations. Other languages may have a similar\nissue, but I am not aware of any table that tracks every language's\nCharacteristics change, so if you're RNGing on a non-English game, you\nmay have to figure this out by yourself using a Pokémon wiki site of\nthat language for example.\n\n\nWith my desired nature now hit and me knowing which Advance exactly that\nis, I'll try stopping on the same Advance 2 more times to make sure\nit's consistent. And with that the preparation for getting a perfect\nIV shiny Roamer the Safe way is done. If you haven't already, save the\ntarget Seed info somewhere (e.g. in the form of a screenshot of the\nsearcher window) and then copy the PID of the Advance that you\nhit (you can e.g. just click on the PID of your hit Advance in the\ngenerated results and use ctrl+c to copy it; FBF114D0 in my case since I\nhit Advance 1772).\n\n\n\nTo start the Risky way, you'll want to open up PokeFinder, go to the\nGen 5 tab and once there open the Static option.\n\nIn the Gen 5 Static window's top left, make sure the Profile of the\ngame you wish to do this in is selected and right below the Profile\noption switch to the searcher tab in which there are 3 different\nsections labeled \"RNG Info\", \"Settings\" and \"Filters\".\n\nIn the RNG Info section put the Initial Advances to 1715 if\nyou're on Black 1 or to 420 if you're on White 1 (I use\nBlack 1 for this example), put the Max Advances to 10 and input a\ndate range you wish to search through (I personally would pick the\nfull current month) whilst leaving the Initial IV Advances, Max IV\nAdvances and Lucky Power all at 0. Next in the Settings section,\nselect the Roamers Category which will automatically select your\nversion's Roamer and finally in the Filters section input your\ndesired IVs, Hidden Power (which fully depends on IVs Hidden Power\nIV Combinations. | Smogon Forums)\nand nature. Do not search for a Shiny, but just leave that\noption at \"any\", as you're trying to find a not-shiny Advance that\nyou can later turn shiny with a TID/SID combination.\n\nThe Initial Advances sit at those oddly specific seeming numbers because\nRoute 7 can have different weather on it depending on the season and\nprecise date (Clear weather which is just the absence of any of the\nthree following weathers, Rain, Hail or Snow). When you exit the house\non Route 7 to start the Roamer cutscene, whichever weather there is on\nyour current target date will appear until Tornadus/Thundurus descends\nfrom the sky. Rain, Hail and Snow all advance the RNG forward fairly\nquickly at different speeds making you hit a far later Advance than if\nthe weather was Clear. Now you'd think why don't we just pick a target\ndate with Clear weather then and for White 1 and Thundurus you'd be\nright as Clear is the optimal weather, however if you're going for\nTornadus in Black 1 you actually want it to specifically Rain\nbeforehand. This is because, for some unknown reason, the Rain Cutscene\nthat Tornadus summons will sometimes extend way past its usual duration\nand make you hit an Advance several dozen to even 200-300 Advances later\nthan expected. This phenomenon happens by far the least often when it\nalready rained on the route just before Tornadus descends from the sky.\nSo for Tornadus you want a Rainy day, which on average Advances\nby around 1705 between you exiting the house and Tornadus generating,\nwhilst for Thundurus you want a target date on a Clear day,\nwhich on average Advances by around 410 between you exiting the house\nand Thundurus generating. You should start searching at 1715/420 with 10\nMax Advances (the Max Advances start counting from the Initial Advances\nmaking the range it searches 1715-1725/420-430) instead of 1705/410 to\nhave at least 10 Advances to confirm the Seed you're on using\nChatot/saving and then be able to find the nature you want by stopping\non an Advance not too far away (10 at most in this case). Which days of\nwhat seasons it Rains, Snows and Hails on at Route 7 you can see in this\ntable (for some reason only Winter months have variation):\n\nSeasons cycle through three times per year. So January is Spring,\nFebruary Summer, March Autumn, April Winter and then in May it goes back\nto Spring etc. (Data from the Bulbapedias Rain and Hail articles\nRain - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia,\nHail (weather condition) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia).\nSince Summer has the by far most Clear days and Spring and Autumn have\nthe by far most Rainy days, I recommend to search through any 1\nfull Spring or Autumn month of your choice for Tornadus or any 1\nfull Summer month of your choice for Thundurus.\nWith all the fields now filled out, press search. If you get no\nresults you can either search through another month, increase Max\nAdvances (will make each attempt take longer later and since you'll most\nlikely have to do this several times, I'd not recommend it) or enable\nmore Keypresses in your Profile (I recommend to have at least none, 1, 2\nand 3 Keypresses enabled and maybe even 4 and 5 too. But no more than 5\nunless you have more than 10 fingers lol; you may need to search through\nseveral months before finding a suitable target Seed when looking for 6\nspecific IVs as it's pretty rare. With only 5 specific IVs and up to 5\nKeypresses, a single month should likely produce several results\nthough).\n\nWith a few results found, there's one more thing to pay attention to and\nthat is the specific time of your target Seed. This is because after\nyou RNG the Roamer, it'll start wandering through the region, and where\nexactly it goes depends on your current time of day and the season\n(Roaming\nPokémon,\nTime - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon\nencyclopedia).\n\nAnd since after the 8th gym you do not yet have access to Routes 11, 12,\n13, 14 and 15, you will want to make sure that either your target Seed\nis not in the early morning hours or that you later remember to beat\nGhetsis first and explore some of the east of Unova before starting the\nRoamer RNG (the late evening is fine, as you can just go back and forth\nbetween Routes until it is on Routes 9 or 10 and not on 11). For my\nBlack Version Tornadus RNG I will choose the shown 5IV, 25 Attack Seed\non the 4th of July 2025, which is a Rainy day, at 21:53:36 with the\nKeypresses R + L + B + Left that has a Timid nature on Advance 1772.\nAnd with that the preparation for getting a perfect IV shiny Roamer the\nRisky way is done. This guide will not explain how to do the actual\nRoamer RNG later as that is a subject for its own guide. If you haven't\nalready, save the target Seed info somewhere (e.g. in the form of a\nscreenshot of the searcher window) and then copy the PID of the\ntarget (you can e.g. just click on the PID of your hit Advance in the\ngenerated results and use ctrl+c to copy it; FBF114D0 in my case).\n\n\nNext Steps...\nYou can now return to the TID/SID RNG guide and\nRNG for an ID pair that makes the PID of the Roamer you found shiny.\n\n\n","description":"Information on how to prepare for Roamer RNG during TID/SID RNG.","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/extra credit/roamer/","title":"BW1 Roamer ID Preparations"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/intermediate/":{"body":"","description":"Learn more about RNG Tech while keeping things simple","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/intermediate/","title":"Intermediate"},"https://retailrng.com/bw/intermediate/coming-soon/":{"body":"","description":"Intermediate isn't quite ready yet!","id":"https://retailrng.com/bw/intermediate/coming-soon/","title":"Coming Soon!"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/":{"body":"","description":"List of guides to RNG Manip in Sinnoh.","id":"https://retailrng.com/dppt/","title":"Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum Guides"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/advanced/":{"body":"","description":"Toughest Manips Available","id":"https://retailrng.com/dppt/advanced/","title":"Advanced"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/advanced/coming-soon/":{"body":"","description":"Advanced isn't quite ready yet!","id":"https://retailrng.com/dppt/advanced/coming-soon/","title":"Coming Soon!"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/beginner/":{"body":"","description":"Quick start and guides for installing the AdiDoks theme on your preferred operating system.","id":"https://retailrng.com/dppt/beginner/","title":"Beginner"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/beginner/starter-rng/":{"body":"Overview\nIn this guide, we will be covering how to manipulate a trainer ID and\nsecret ID, as well as a shiny starter Pokémon.

In this window, edit the minimum delay\nvalue to be 5600, or a greater value if you choose. This will give you\nsome leeway during the intro sequence. Then, type a year into the\nYear box, such as \"2025,\" press the TSV button under\nFilters, enter your target TSV, and click search. You will see a\nlist of values appear in the space below.\n\nChoose a seed from here to save for later, and make a note of the TID\nand SID, as you will be targeting it.\n \nShiny 5 / 6 IV Pokemon ID\n \nShiny 5 / 6 IV Pokemon ID (Option B)\nFor this option, you will be searching for a Pokémon with a high IV\nspread, a desirable nature, and any other qualities you want, other than\nshiny.\nTo do so, open PokeFinder, go to the Gen4 tab, then select\nStatic for the particular Pokémon you'd like to have these qualities\nin the future.\n\nEnter the \"Searcher\" tab.\nFilter for your desired Pokémon, IVs, Ability, Gender, Hidden Power\ntype, and Nature.\nCopy the value in the PID field and make a note of the seed for later.\n\nNow, back on the main window, go to IDs.\n\nIn the following window, edit the minimum delay value to be 5600, or\na greater value if you choose. Then, type a year into the Year box,\nsuch as \"2025,\" press the PID button under Filters, enter your\ntarget PID, and click the search button. You will see a list of values\nappear in the space below.\n\nMake a note of the Seed, TID, and SID.\nCopy the seed and go back to the main window.\n \n\nTrainer ID Manip\nNow that you have a seed for your ID combination from one of the options\nabove, you are ready to begin the final setup for this portion of the\nguide.\nGo to Gen 4 Tools and select Seed to Time.\n\nIn the new window, paste your seed into the Seed box, enter your\ndesired year, and desired target second. In this instance, we will be\nusing the seed 4D0115FC in the year 2025 with a target second of 59. You\nwill enter that in EonTimer in a moment.\nOnce you click Generate, you will get a list of the possible dates\nand times that will land you on your desired seed, along with a delay\nthat you will enter into EonTimer.\n\nOpen EonTimer, if you have not already, and ensure your EonTimer\nsettings are configured for your DS system of choice. Either NDS - Slot\n1 for DS / DS Lite, DSi, or 3DS mode.\n\nThen enter your target second in the Target Second box, and then do\nthe same with the target delay. Do not modify the calibrated value\nslots.\n\nWhen your timings update, be sure to look under Minutes Before\nTarget.\nIn this instance, it is one minute before the target time, so with a\ntarget time of 1:17:59 on January 1st, 2025, on the DS, you would enter\n1:16 on January 1st, 2025, when setting the clock later. Keep this in\nmind, as it may change when calibrating.\nNow, on your device of choice, open your time and date settings and\nenter the date first, then enter your time and start your timer at the\nsame time you confirm the entry.\n\nDS\n \n \n3DS\n \n \n\nReboot to your home menu as fast as you can and wait for the first\ntimer.\nStart your game as soon as the first timer ends.\nOnce the second timer begins, you must complete the intro sequence as\nquickly as possible, then wait on the TV screen for the final\ncountdown.\nThe games have different screens based on which game you're playing. Click the tab relevant to you to see said screen.\n\nDiamond &amp; Pearl\n \n \nPlatinum\n \n \n\nCheck your ID.\nIf you missed it, go back to the IDs page and enter the TID you\nobtained, the target date and time, and the delay range to search. You\nshould see at least one matching result.\nIn this instance I missed and you very likely will, too. Now, we need to adjust.\nTrainer ID Adjust\n\nWhen you locate where you hit, enter the delay that PokeFinder gives you\ninto the Delay Hit box of EonTimer and click Update.\n\nIf you are unable to hit the Target Second, you will need to\nincrease or decrease this value in EonTimer accordingly until you are\nable to reliably hit it.\nIf your target delay is even and you hit an odd delay, or vice versa, in\nyour date and time settings on your console, change the year by one, but\nDO NOT change the value in PokeFinder. Optionally, instead of\nchanging the year on the console, you can change the keyboard mode, such\nas upper to lower, when you are done naming your character, to achieve\nthe same effect.\nRepeat until you get your target ID.\n\nOnce you get it, we need to make a profile!\nMaking a Profile\nPokeFinder has feature that lets you store a games settings, including that specific games Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID. I'll quickly walk you through how to set one up. \nIn PokeFinders main window, click the Gen 4 Tools dropdown, and then click Profile Manager.\n\nA new window will pop up. Mine has a few profiles in it already, but your window should be empty.\nIn this window, click New.\n\nAnother new window will pop up. Here, you can type the name of the profile, select the game you're playing, select if you have the National Pokedex yet, and input your TID/SID.\n\nOnce you input the info, click Okay and the window will close.\nThe info will now appear in the Profile Manager, where you can click Done.\n\nStarter Manip\nTo manipulate a starter, you must have completed the introductory\nsequence and be saved in front of the bag.\nBefore, if you chose the 5 / 6 IV Pokémon path, you should already have\na seed for a Pokémon to target. If you chose a Cute Charm ID, you\nwill need to refer to the steps above in that section to find a target;\nyour options will be more limited in terms of competitively viable\nshinies, so do not expect anything perfect.\nOnce you have your seed ready, open Seed to Time\n\nInput your seed, desired target year, and desired target second.\nOnce you hit Generate, click a Date/Time + Delay, and enter a\ndesired search range in the +/- Delay box. If you're coming from\nimmediately doing an ID manipulation, I suggest a range of 20. The +/-\nSecond generally only needs to be considered if you are unable to hit\nyour target second, which, if you're coming from the ID portion, you\nshould have that already narrowed down, so I am using 0 here.\nClick Generate. You will see a list of possible adjacent seeds.\nJust as in the ID manipulation section, input the Delay value and\nTarget Second into EonTimer, change your clock settings, and start\nthe timer at the same time you set the clock. Remember to take note of\nthe Minutes Before Target and adjust your clock accordingly.\n\nWait on the Home Screen to start the game at the end of the first timer.\n\nThen wait on the Save File Select Screen for the end of the second\ntimer.\n\nOnce the timer ends, open the briefcase as quickly as possible and\nselect your starter of choice. You will very likely miss on the first\nattempt.\nStarter Adjust\nOnce you complete the battle with the wild Starly (DP) or Rival (Pt),\nview the summary of your starter.\nIn the Static &gt; Searcher tab, open the IV calculator.\n\nSelect the correct game from the drop-down as well as the Pokémon we\nwill be calculating IVs for. Ignore the Hidden Power type as there is no\nway to know it at this point. Enter the stats and nature of your\nstarter, as well as the characteristic. The characteristic can be\nused to deduce IVs further at the low level we are forced to search\nwith. Adding a row will let you enter another level which should help\nbring the IV ranges closer to the true value, decreasing the manual\nsearch effort.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: some of the characteristics have been renamed in newer\ngenerations. PokeFinder uses the updated names. The two\ncharacteristics affected are: \"Often dozes off\" which is now called\n\"Takes plenty of siestas\" and \"Often scatters things\" which is now\ncalled \"Nods off a lot.\"\nNot strictly required, but it may make things easier to get the stats\nfor the Pokémon at level 5 if you win the battle. To do so, look at the\nstat increases when you level up and subtract those values from the new\nstats.\n\nThe IVs will automatically update the search filter; you just have to\nadd the nature to search. Ensure that you're searching a small\nadvancement range, such as 1-5, as well as the appropriate delay range\nwhere your seed lies. So, with a target delay of 1033, I'd search\n900-1100 if I already have some calibration, otherwise I'd use a\nslightly wider range.\n\nClick Generate, then order by seed by clicking the Seed header\nin the results pane. This will help you find your hit.\nSearch for your target seed in this list or an adjacent seed from Seed\nto Time that we generated earlier. Use the Pokémon's characteristic to\nensure you have the right one.\n\nOnce you locate the seed, take the delay and paste it into your\ndelay hit, hit update. If you were later on the advances this most\nlikely means an NPC was moving and advanced the RNG. In this situation,\nyou'll have to enter the bag and select your pokemon faster to avoid\nthis.\n\n\nRemember that if your target delay is even and you hit an odd delay,\nor vice versa, in your date and time settings on your console, change\nthe year by one, but DO NOT change the value in PokeFinder.\n\nHere we have achieved the desired result. A shiny, jolly, 6IV Turtwig!\nPerfect for a Gen 4 UU Synthesis set.\nNext Steps...\nWith the Starter &amp; TID/SID Manip out of the way, you're ready to move on to the next steps!\nEither Static or Wild Manips will do, although, Wild is slightly more challenging. Hope to see you there!\n","description":"How to RNG Manip your SID & get a Shiny Starter in DPPt","id":"https://retailrng.com/dppt/beginner/starter-rng/","title":"Diamond/Pearl/Platinum TID & Starter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/dppt/beginner/static/":{"body":"Overview\nIn this guide, we will be covering how to manipulate a stationary\nPokémon, which includes legendaries, gifts, and other \"manually\nencountered\" Pokémon. This guide DOES NOT cover roaming Pokémon.\n\nThis basic manip instills the foundational knowledge you will need to\nperform many other manipulations in the Generation 4 games.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokémon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum\n\n\nDS / DS Lite, DSi, 3DS / 2DS System\n\n\nWindows 10/11, MacOS, Linux PC\n\n\nIn-game Requirements\n\n\nChatot with a recorded Chatter\n\n\nMasterball to capture the target and calibrate (optional)\n\n\nCoin flip Poketch app (optional)\n\n\nSID for shiny Pokémon (optional)\n\n\nFalse Swipe user (optional)\n\n\nRare Candies (optional)\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\nPokefinder\n\n\nEontimer\n3.0.0-rc.6\n\n\nVideo Guides\n\nStationary\nManipulation\n\nInitial Setup\nThis type of manipulation is best done with the Coin Flip app to\nquickly search for seeds you hit. However, it is not required.\nTo obtain the Coin Flip app, you must speak to the rich boy inside\nthis house at the Grand Lake Hotel, which requires Rock Climb.\n\nThe second way to find a seed hit is to capture the Pokémon and then\npinpoint it in Pokefinder; both of these methods will be demonstrated at\na later point in the guide.\nThe primary requirement is at least one Chatot with a recorded Chatter.\nChatot learns Chatter at level 21, and it can be obtained by trading a\nBuizel in Eterna City or by capturing it on Route 222.\nEnsure your Pokefinder profile is set up. If you do not know how to\ncreate one, it is covered\nhere\nMake sure to save in front of your target.\nFinding a Target\nIn Pokefinder, go to the Gen 4 tab, then select Static. A new\nwindow will appear.\n\nBe sure to navigate to the Searcher tab highlighted in the image and\nselect your profile if it isn't set automatically.\nHere we have a bunch of filters for the min/max delay and advances, the\ncategory our Pokémon falls under, IV filters, and other parameters such\nas the ability slot, Hidden Power type, nature, gender, and shininess.\n\n\nIV filters range from 0-31 in each stat. The left is the minimum\nvalue, right is the maximum.\n\n\nThe ability filter allows you to choose which ability a Pokémon has,\nif it has more than one ability.\n\n\nHidden Power allows you to choose a Hidden Power type that will be\ndependent on the IVs of the Pokémon\n\n\nShininess should only be selected if you have your SID. It will\nallow you to search for shiny Pokémon. Star/Square should almost\nalways be selected unless you care what type of shiny it is in\nSword/Shield.\n\n\nLeads are not required, but they can help you get the desired\nPokémon. However, they do not work on gift Pokémon. Pokefinder only\nsupports searching with Cute Charm and Synchronize, but there\nare more abilities with out-of-battle effects that may inhibit your\nability to hit your target, including but not limited to: Pressure,\nStatic, or Keen Eye. DO NOT have Pokémon with these abilities in your\nlead slot.\nHere, you should copy the Min/Max Delay and Min/Max Advance that\nI have set up under RNG Info. The other filters will depend on what\nyou want to target.\n\nIn Platinum, if you are targeting Giratina-Origin in the Distortion\nWorld, your minimum advances should be set to 11. This is because\nloading the overworld in the Distortion World causes 11 advances to\noccur. This happens each time you exit from a menu, such as the party,\nas well. Keep this in mind if you have a far target.\nUnderstand that filtering for shiny Pokémon limits your options by a\nlot, which is why I'm searching for 30-31 IVs in only special attack\nand speed. My search here is made even more strict by asking for a\nspecific ability slot, desired natures, and Hidden Power type.\nThe highlighted spread is suitable for the Drifloon I'd like to have. It's shiny, with some pretty good stats. Also, take note of what Advance your target is on. Mine is 19. I suggest picking something around there for your first manip, and definitely above 5.\nWhen you find a suitable spread for yourself, make a note of the\nadvances, hover over the seed, and right-click it. A small list will\nappear. Click Generate Times for Seed.\n\nA new window will appear. Here you will select a target date and time.\n\nOnce you choose a target, click it, then hit the generate button at the bottom to generate a list of adjacent seeds.  Now we're ready to manipulate the Pokémon.\nPrepping for your target\nNow that we have a target date and time, enter the date in your system's\nclock settings, as well as the time, but don't confirm the time yet.\n\nDS\n \n\n \n3DS\n \n\n \n\nOpen EonTimer, go to the Settings area, and select the device you\nwill be manipulating with.\n\nThen, enter the Target Delay and Target Second from your\nselected time in their respective fields, and be sure to take note of\nthe Minutes Before Target. You will subtract that number from the\nminutes on your clock. So, instead of setting the clock for 15:56, it is\nset to 15:55 because there is one minute before the target.\nIn addition, set Calibrated Delay to 600.\n\nStart the timer and the clock at the same time.\nNow, you can either wait at the Home Screen to boot the game, or\nboot the game and then Soft Reset at the end of the first timer\nstage. The latter will provide better consistency on DSi and 3DS due to\nlonger boot times.\n\nDS\n \n \n3DS\n \n \n\nAfter the first timer stage ends, you will wait on the Save File\nSelect screen until the end of the second timer.\n\nOnce the game loads, there are two options to check the delay hit and\ncalibrate if you missed.\nAttempting &amp; Calibrating\n\nCoin Flips\n Coin Flips\nWith the Coin Flip app on your Poketch, you can quickly verify your\nseed. If you do not have this app, click the Catch and Check tab. It must be noted that this\nmethod is recommended to be done in an area with little or no moving\nNPCs, as they will cause advancements and may make you overshoot your\ntarget when listening to Chatot.\nIn the Gen 4 Seed to Time window where we generated the adjacent\nseeds, click Search Flips.\n\nThis will open a small window with two\nicons corresponding to \"heads\" or \"tails.\"\n\nNow, back in the game, you will flip the coin multiple times and press\nthe icon of each side that lands in the Search Flips window. Keep\nflipping until there is only 1 result, then press \"OK\".\n\n\nYou will find that the seed you hit has been highlighted.\n\nHere I hit 3920, when my target was 3922.\nIMPORTANT: Delay is a value that only increments 2 by 2. This means that if you hit an \"odd\" delay when aiming for an \"even\" (example: 3921 vs\n3922), you'll always miss by 1. To fix this, you can attempt to start a new game and then back out by pressing\nB. This will switch the delay to the opposite of whatever you're hitting. \n\nYou can enter the delay you see associated with the seed into EonTimer\nunder Delay Hit, then press Update. Your timer will adjust, and\nyou should now be able to hit your target seed more easily.\n\nOnce you've confirmed your seed with coin flips, we can catch our target Pokemon!\nCopy the seed you're targeting into the Generator tab.\n\nOpen the party menu and open your Chatot's summary, the recorded chatter will play at\na certain pitch that changes each advance, flip back and forth between\nyour Pokémons' summaries and listen to the Chatot's pitch.\n\nOn each flip, look one advance further in the Generator tab; the\npitch should match up. If you can't tell the difference in pitches, that's okay, we just need to count\nthe number of times we hear the Chatter until one advance before the\ntarget Pokémon. In this case, it's Advance 18 with a Medium Low pitch.\nExit the summary, party view, the start menu, and encounter your\nPokémon. \nIt should be your target! If it's not, try again and double check the coin flips &amp; chatot pitches. Also, make sure there's no NPCs nearby that move randomly. \n\n\nHere I have my desired Shiny Drifloon.\n \nCatch and Check\n \nCatch and Check\nIf the Coin Flip app is unavailable to you, then you can simply\nattempt the manipulation from here.\nBe sure that you're saved in front of your target.\nCopy the seed you're targeting into the Generator tab.\n\nOnce you load into the game at the end of the second timer, open your\nparty and open your Chatot's summary, the recorded chatter will play at\na certain pitch that changes each advance, flip back and forth between\nyour Pokémons' summaries and listen to the Chatot's pitch.\n\nOn each flip, look one advance further in the Generator tab; the\npitch should match up. If it doesn't, that's okay, we just need to count\nthe number of times we hear the Chatter until one advance before the\ntarget Pokémon.\nExit the summary, party view, the start menu, and encounter your\nPokémon.\nYou likely missed on the first go if you haven't been able to calibrate.\nSimply capture the Pokémon; it's good to have Masterballs on hand if\nyou're targeting a legendary.\n\nFrom here, go back to the Searcher tab, or in the Generator tab\nif you verified the seed with Coin Flips, clear all of your previous\nfilters, and open the IV Calculator.\n\nSelect the correct game from the drop-down as well as the Pokémon we\nwill be calculating IVs for. Ignore the Hidden Power type as it is not\nrequired. Enter the stats and nature of your Pokémon, as well as the\ncharacteristic. The characteristic can be used to deduce IVs further\nwithout levelling up.\nAdding a row will let you enter another level, which should help bring\nthe IV ranges closer to the true value, decreasing the manual search\neffort. This is best achieved with Rare Candies.\n\nIMPORTANT: Some of the characteristics have been renamed in newer\ngenerations. PokeFinder uses the updated names. The two\ncharacteristics affected are: \"Often dozes off,\" which is now called\n\"Takes plenty of siestas,\" and \"Often scatters things,\" which is now\ncalled \"Nods off a lot.\"\nOnce you click Find IVs, go back to the Searcher window. You'll\nfind that the IV filters have been automatically applied. You should now\nadd the nature, ability slot, and gender, if applicable, to narrow your\nsearch.\nClick Search, and click the \"Seed\" table header to sort by seed.\nLook for one of the adjacent seeds we generated in Seed to Time\nearlier.\n\n\nIf you don't see a matching seed, then increase the -/+ ranges for the\nDelay or Second.\nIMPORTANT: Delay is a value that only increments 2 by 2. This means that if you hit an \"odd\" delay when aiming for an \"even\" (example: 3921 vs\n3922), you'll always miss by 1. To fix this, you can attempt to start a new game and then back out by pressing\nB. This will switch the delay to the opposite of whatever you're hitting. \n\nYou can enter the delay you see associated with the seed into EonTimer\nunder Delay Hit, then press Update. Your timer will adjust, and\nyou should now be able to hit your target seed more easily.\n\nRepeat this section until you achieve the result.\n\nHere I have my desired Shiny Drifloon.\n \n\nNext Steps...\nWith static Pokemon under your belt, the next challenge to tackle is Wild Pokemon!

What if you want something better, with multiple\nperfect IVs for competitive play or the battle frontier.\nTo do this, we’ll need to use the Battle Record feature showcased in our\nSafari Zone guide. In addition to that, we’ll take advantage of Contest\nPaintings, which let you reseed the Emeralds RNG based on how many\nframes have advanced since the game has booted.\nThis guide will focus specifically on Static Encounters. While the\nprocess works nearly identically for Wild, we will have a separate guide\nfor them, focusing on how to alter &amp; control the Wild 1, Wild 2, and\nWild 4 Methods.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Emerald (any language)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA Emulator,\nor Pokemon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire.\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nEnter the Battle Frontier once so you have the Battle Frontier Trainer\nCard.\n\n\nA Pokemon with Sweet Scent\n\n\nA Pokemon with Fly\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\nAccess to Lilycove city\n\n\n5-10 Rare Candies.

Go to the Ten\nLines website, and click the Searcher Tab.\n\nYou’ll be on a tab we haven’t showcased before. This is for finding a\nPokemons 32 bit PRNG State by searching for IVs &amp; Nature.\nSet the Game to Emerald Painting Seed\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID if you’re going for a Shiny.\nLeave Method as Static 1.\nCategory is a list of all the types of Static Encounters in Pokemon\nEmerald. They should be self explanatory. In this guide, I’ll be aiming\nfor Regirock, who is a Legend.\nAfter that, I select Registeel from the Pokemon dropdown.\nI’ll leave Shininess at Any.\n\n  Note: Why not shiny?  \n  Emerald is one of the most versatile games to RNG Manip within Gen 3,\nhowever, one of its biggest downsides is the lack of a consistent way to\nRNG Manip your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID.\n\nWhile technically possible, there are no extremely consistent methods,\nand it’s a quadruple frame perfect input.\n\nThis means that, since we haven’t picked our TID &amp; SID, we likely do not\nhave any Perfect, Shiny Pokemon available to us.\n\nMost people circumvent this with glitches, like Arbitrary Code\nExecution, that allow them to change their TID &amp; SID into whatever\nthey’d like.\n\nFor this guide, I’ll just accept a non-shiny Registeel.\n\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you’d like. I’ll be going for an\nImpish Registeel with a 31 IV for HP, ATK, DEF, SPD, and SPE.\n\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get at least\none result:\n\nI have 3 different results. Each one is the 32 Bit Seed that our desired\nPokemon can occur on. All of the IVs &amp; Nature line up with what I’d\nlike, so now we have to use the Initial Seed tab to parse these results\nto find which one works the best for us.\nPicking an Initial Seed\nPick any of your results, at random, and click the Initial Seed button\non the far right of them. This will switch you to what is typically the\nTen Lines default tab, Initial Seed.\nEverything except Console &amp; Game will be automatically populated based\non the Searcher tabs results. So, set your console, &amp; click Emerald\nPainting Seed, then hit submit.\nYou’ll get an amount of results equal to the Result Count field, which\nis 10 by default.\n\nTo parse the results of this tab, we have to understand how we’re going\nto be changing the seed using a Contest Painting.\nWhat is a Painting Seed?\nThis is the Contest Painting I’m referring to. It’s to the right of the\nPC in Lilycoves contest hall.\n\nThere’s three here, and all of them will work the same. Mine has a\npicture of my Feraligatr who I ribbon mastered here, but the default\npainting works just fine. In addition, the ones in the Artists Gallery\nwill also work, as long as they’re not empty.\nWhen you talk to a painting, the game takes the value in VblankCounter1\nand uses it to seed the rng. VBlankCounter1 counts how many frames have\npassed since the game launched, that’s it.\nIn practice, since the game runs at 60fps, hitting a painting seed is no\ndifferent than successfully landing a target Pokemon like we would in a\nbasic RNG Manip from seed 0.\nTen Lines Initial Seed tab tells us what the Painting Seed timer will be\nin the Seed (Dec) column. It also tells us how many RNG Advances to wait\nafter we hit our initial seed to get our desired Pokemon.\nIn addition, thanks to Emerald's Battle Record feature, we can preserve\nthat seed after successfully hitting it.\nThe flow of getting a specific seed within your battle record goes like\nthis:\n\n\nTalk to the painting to try and hit your seed.\n\n\nFind what seed you hit by capturing a Wild Pokemon\n\n\nIf you hit the wrong seed, calibrate\n\n\nIf you hit the right seed, save it as a Battle Record.\n\n\nKnowing how the process works informs how we choose a result from the\nTen Lines. What we want is a Seed with a low value in the Seed (dec)\ncolumn, which is how long we wait in front of the paintings, but a\ndecently sized value in the Advances column, which is how long after the\npainting wait the seed will take place.\nA low value in Seed (dec) lets us attempt our initial seed rather\nquickly, while a higher value in Advances lets us have plenty of time to\nverify our seed is correct, then run to the frontier to make a battle\nrecord.\nFrom the result I picked, seed 102F fits all the criteria.\n\nIts decimal wait time is only 4143 Frames, which is only about a minute,\nand the Advances is 40196, which is about 10 minutes. Plenty of time to\nverify my seed.\nIf your page has no results that allow you to quickly reset for a seed,\nyou can go back to the searcher and pick another one of the results if\nyou have them. I ended up picking the third result to get this seed.\n\nWith our seed picked out, we can try to hit our seed!\nHitting our Seed!\nBecause the Painting Seed reseeds the RNG based on how many frames have\npassed since the game launched, manipping which seed you get is very\nsimilar to a standard static manip.\nTo do so, let’s set up Eon Timer. We’ll be using the C tab for\nthis process.\n\nEvery time you hit the + button, a new timer will appear. You will\nneed either 2 or 3 depending on if you use a pretimer (the 5 second\ncountdown to a soft reset). Click the tab to see what the timer should\nlook like, based on if you use a pretimer or not.\n\nPRETIMER\n If you use a pretimer, hit the + button 3 times. In the first timer,\nset Unit to ms, and put 5000 in the Target box. This will be\nour pretimer.\nIn the second timer, set Unit to Seed (Hex). Then, input the\nvalue from the Seed (hex) column in Ten Lines in the Target box.\nIn my case it’s 102F. This is how long we will be waiting in front of\nthe contest painting.\n\nLastly, with Eon Timers default window size, you’ll have to scroll\ndown to see your third timer.\nHere, set your Unit to Advances, and put 2500 into the\nTarget box. We are NOT aiming for our final target right away. This\nwill be a random wild Pokemon that we will use to verify our initial\nseed.\n\n \nNO PRETIMER\n \nIf you soft reset and start Eon Timer at the same time, without a\npretimer, hit the + button in the C tab twice.\nIn the first timer, set Unit to Seed (Hex). Then, input the\nvalue from the Seed (hex) column in Ten Lines in the Target box.\nIn my case it’s 102F. This is how long we will be waiting in front of\nthe contest painting.\nIn the second timer, set your Unit to Advances, and put 2500\ninto the Target box. We are NOT aiming for our final target right\naway. This will be a random wild Pokemon that we will use to verify our\ninitial seed.\n \n\nFor the rest of the guide, I’ll be using Eon Timer without a\npretimer.\nAlso make sure to double check your console in Eon Timers settings!\n\nI selected NDS - Slot 2, since I am doing this on an original DS.\nWith Eon Timer setup, head back to Ten Lines.\nOn your chosen target, push the Calibration Button.\n\nThis page will mostly be set up, but we have to change a few things.\nFirstly, change Minimum Advances to 0, and Maximum Advances to\n4000.\nThen, change Method to All Wild Methods.\nAlso change Location to Victory Road 1F.\nLastly, check the Filter Box next to the Pokemon Species, though\ndon’t change the species yet. This will make Ten Lines only search for\nwhichever species you find when you’re calibrating.\nYou may also input your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID if you’re aiming for a\nshiny. Since I am not, I opted to not input them.\n\nWe’re now all set up to try and make a Battle Record of a new seed!\nTo make a Battle Record, we want to quickly end a battle in any\nfacility without clicking Run. The quickest for this is the Battle\nTower. You can do level 50 or Open level.\nYou can win or lose, it doesn’t matter. If you win, though, you have to\nclick Retire before your next battle to end your streak.\nI bring 3 Pokemon with Explosion / Self Destruct to make sure the match\nis always over as fast as possible.\n\n\n  Note: Explosion Pokemon\n  Here's a few options for explosion/self desutrct Pokemon in Emerald. \n\n\n\nVoltorb / Electrode - Level 27\n\n\nBaltoy / Claydol - Level 19\n\n\nRegice / Registeel / Regirock - Move Reminder\n\n\nKoffing / Weezing - Level 17\n\n\nGeodude / Graveler - Level 21\n\n\n\nWe also want to have a Pokemon with fly &amp; sweet scent with us, as I find\nvictory road is the best place to verify your Painting Seed, and sweet\nscent can force a wild encounter. Tropius is great for this, as it\nlearns both moves.\nLastly, make sure you’ve got an empty spot in your party. With the party\nset up, save in front of a Painting in Lilycove.\n\nClick Start Eon Timer, and get through the intro sequence as quickly\nas possible. Then, wait in front of the Painting until the Seed\n(Hex) timer finishes counting down. When it does, press A to view\nthe painting.\n\nOnce you view the painting, the next timer will immediately start\ncounting down. Press B to close the painting, and head to victory\nroad's entrance as quickly as possible.\nWhen you enter, take one step away from the door tile, because Sweet\nScent does not work if you’re right at the door.\n\nThen, open your party menu and hover over Sweet Scent until the timer\nfinishes counting down.\n\nWhen the timer ends, press Sweet Scent &amp; catch whichever Pokemon\nappears.\n\nI got a level 40 Modest Golbat. Input the Species, Nature &amp; Gender into\nthe Ten Lines. Once you select a nature, the IV Calculator will appear.\nYou should be familiar with it by this point, so input all your Pokemons\nstats &amp; hit Submit.\n\nYou can see I have two results, and they’re the exact same Golbat but\nabout 60 Advances apart. This is actually okay, because we only care\nabout the Seed. And we only have one seed result, 1030.\nIf you have multiple possible results in terms of Seed, increase your\nPokemons level in the IV Calculator until you’ve only got one.\nOnce you’ve got only one result, put it into the Hit box for the\nUnit: Seed (Hex) timer, and click Update. The value in the\nCalibration field will change.\nYou do not need to change the calibration of Advances at all. Do not\nworry about it!\n\nWith your update Calibration, try again until you get a Pokemon that\nsays it has the same Seed (hex) as your target.\n\nA few attempts later, I found this Hariyama who was on Seed 102F,\nwhich is my target. Once I hit my target, run to the frontier &amp; start a\nchallenge in the Battle Tower immediately.\nDo not wait, just start the battle right away.\nTo see how to progress, click the option below:\n\nLOSE BATTLE\n \nIf you lost the battle, continue through all the dialogue by just\nmashing the A button.\n\nNote: Fastest way to lose\nThis is why I recommend having 3 explosion Pokemon in your party. You\ncan just click the move without any thought, and you’ll always lose, as\nseen below.\n\n\n \nWIN BATTLE\n \n\nIf you win the battle, click RETIRE from this menu.\n\nThen click YES from this menu.\n \n\nYou will be escorted to the lobby, and the clerk will ask if you want to\nrecord your last battle on your Frontier Pass. Say YES to this.\n\nIt looks like this. Once you say yes, you also must save the game\nregularly, or your Battle Record will not stick.\nAt this point, we’re done making the Battle Record! Now we have to find\nwhere we are in the RNG Sequence, and determine how much longer we have\nto wait before we’re close to our target.\nFinding our current RNG State\nTo get started, let’s head back to the Ten Lines to make some minor\nadjustments.\nSet the Seed+- to 0, and change the Maximum Advances to 50000.\nThis will make it so we’re only searching for a Pokemon on the seed we\nhit, in my case it’s 102F, and since we do not know our current\nAdvance amount, making the Maximum around 50,000 will cast a\nvery wide net, depending on how long it took you to reach the frontier\nAFTER searching for your Seed.\n\nThen, I’m going to head to the Victory Road 1F again.\n\nAlso remember to bring your Sweet Scent user with you!\nNow, in Eon Timer, we’re going to go to the Custom Tab. Here, set\nthe Unit to Advances, and input how 800 Advances.\n\nAt this point, we’re ready!\nWhat we’re going to do is open the Battle Record, then, while the\nintro to the battle happens, close the Battle Record with B, and\npress Start on Eon Timer at the same time!\n\nI closed it around here. The RNG doesn’t advance until a Pokemon makes\nan attack, so you don’t have to rush.\nWhile Eon Timer counts down, I go to the Pokemon Menu and hover over the\nfield move sweet scent, waiting for it to finish counting down.\n\nThen, when Eon Timer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\nI caught this Careful Loudred.\n  \nI’ll input the Stats, Gender, Nature, &amp; Species into the Ten Lines to\nsee where I landed.\n\nWe can see that I landed on Advance 15336 after waiting only\n800. In addition to that, Sweet Scent generally has a delay of\naround 260~, so subtracting both of those from my result, opening the\nBattle Record puts me roughly at Advance 15076 of Seed 102F.\nOnce you know your position in the RNG here, you can soft reset your\ngame. This Pokemon is not necessary to keep, and I don’t want to waste\nthe Master Ball I just used on it!\nIf we go back to the Initial Seed tab of the Ten Lines, we can see my\nTarget Advance is 40196. \nTo find out how many more Advances I have to wait until I am at my\ntarget spread, I have to subtract my target Advances from my\ncurrent Advances.\nSo, in my case, it’s 40196-15076, which is 25,120.\nI don’t want to wait 25120 Advances every attempt, though. So I’m going\nto make a new Battle Record from the current Battle Record.\nDon’t wait exactly the difference you have, though. 25120 would get us\nexactly to our target spread. We need time after we close the Battle\nRecord to interact with our target Pokemon.\nTo play it safe, I subtract 2000 from my target time. So I’ll only be\nwaiting 23120 Advances instead of 25120.\nSo, I’ll now set Eon Timers C tab to be 23120 Advances.\n\nNow we make a new record. To do this, we open the current Battle Record\njust before starting a Battle Tower Challenge, close it &amp; start Eon\nTimer at the same time, and wait the remaining amount of Advances in\nfront of our NPC before starting the battle.\n\nWhen Eon Timer finishes counting down, start the battle! Same as before,\nmake a Battle Record of your match. This will overwrite your\nprevious one. Remember, after the Battle Record is made, save your\ngame normally!\nYou should now be around 2,000 Advances away from your target spread.\nIt’s now time to make an actual attempt on our target, finally!\nBattle Record Manip\nWith our new Battle Record ready, head to your target Pokemon &amp; save in\nfront of it.\n\nNext, in the Ten Lines, we’re going to head back to the Calibration\nTab, and change a few things.\nChange Offset your target Advance - 2000. Or, if you subtracted a\ndifferent number than 2000, do that. In my case, it’s 40196 - 2000, so\n38196.\nThen, change Method to Static 1 &amp; Select your Category &amp;\nSpecies.\n\nIn Eon Timers C tab, set your Advances to 2000.\n\nWe’re now ready to start making attempts! At this point, it’s similar to\nthe Static Manip from beginner, but with Battle Record procedure.\nopen the Battle Record, then, while the intro to the battle happens,\nclose the Battle Record with B, and press Start on Eon Timer\nat the same time!\nThen, when it finishes counting down, interact with your target Pokemon.\nIf you need a refresher on when you should push A, reference the list\nbelow:\n\n  List: When to Encounter\n  \n\nTreecko: Do you choose this POKéMON?

I’ll input that into Eon\nTimers hit box, click update, and try again.\n\nAfter 2 more tries, I hit my target Registeel. It's Impish with 31/31/31/25/31/31 IVs. Perfect for a defensive tank!\n\n\n\nThis can be a tedious RNG to set up, but once you have a Battle Record\nready, you can make a lot of quick attempts on a target that would\notherwise be impossible to attain!\nAnd of course, the Battle Record is reusable. If there’s any other\nstatic encounters who would be good with this target IV + Nature combo,\nuse it!\nNext Steps...\nUp next in Advanced is going to be Wild Battle Record + Painting RNG. As\nstated in the overview, it’s fairly similar to this. You could probably\nfigure out how to apply this technique to Wild battles on your own, to\nbe honest!\nHowever, in the Wild guide, we’ll be covering two extra things.\n\n\nHow to control which method you get from Wild Encounters\n\n\nExtra ways to advance the RNG a bit more quickly than just waiting\nin the overworld.\n\n\nHope to see you there!\n","description":"Learn to get any IV & Nature on statics for competitive play via Battle Record & Contest Paintings!","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/advanced/perfectstatic/","title":"Emerald Perfect IV Static Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/":{"body":"","description":"Quick start and guides for installing the AdiDoks theme on your preferred operating system.","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/","title":"Beginner"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/emerald-static/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter finding your Secret ID and successfully RNG Manipping your Starter\nPokémon, Manipping a Static encounter is the next logical step.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Emerald Painting Seed. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a Nintendo DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 0000, this is the default seed for Emerald. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, we cover how to find it here.\n\n\n  Note: What is Offset?\n  Offset, sometimes called Delay, in Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Fire Red, and Leaf Green is how\nmany RNG Advances occur after you press A to encounter or receive your\nPokémon, but before the Pokémon is generated.\n\nIn the past, we would consult a list that told you what this value was\nfor various encounters. We no longer do this, and no guide here will\nreference such lists. This is for two main reasons.\n\n\nAttempting to hit your target Pokémon, missing it, and calibrating\nyour miss is an integral part of the RNG Process. Figuring out a\nspecific legendaries Offset will only take one of these. Because we\nteach RNGing this way, Offset no longer serves a purpose.\n\nMany people would refrain from performing certain manips if they did\nnot know a Pokémon's Offset. Such hesitance is bad, we do not want\npeople thinking they CANNOT do a manip without an arbitrary list\nsomewhere, when they absolutely can.\n\n\nIn short, Offset is a social construct we as a community have moved\npast the need for.\n\nSet Method to Static 1.\nFor Category &amp; Pokemon, select whatever your target is. The categories are self explanatory.\nIn this example, I will be using Rayquaza. However, I will provide\ninfo for every Static encounter in Emerald so you can apply that\ninfo to your specific situation.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you'd like, and also select if you want a Shiny.\n\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\n\nFor these Pokémon Shininess occurs on the same Advances as the\nStarter Pokémon you RNG'd in the previous\nguide.\nI am using a different copy of Pokémon Emerald, though. So mine will not\nbe the same.\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokémon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time. There are ways to\ncircumvent this issue, but they are difficult techniques covered in our\nAdvanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have none, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, etc.\nI will be aiming for Advance 1748. You can aim for the same\nAdvance as you did for the Starter Pokémon. This is a big\nbenefit of Pokémon Emerald.\n\nOnce you find your Secret\nID,\nyou can aim for the same Advance for your Shiny and hit it over\n&amp; over again on different Pokémon. This allows you to learn the basics\nof RNG Manips through repetition, while getting a bunch of shinies!\n\n  Note: But, aren't all these Pokémon clones?\n  Many people discount / belittle this type of RNG Manip because it\nproduces a lot of PID Clones and can produce True Clones as\nwell. But, what are these things, what's the difference between them,\nand does it even matter?\n\nA PID Clone is often described as RNG Manipping two different\nspecies of Pokémon on the same RNG Advance. This means the two\nPokémon will have the same Nature, IVs, and Shiny Status,\nfor the most part.\n\nA True Clone is RNG Manipping the same species of Pokémon on the\nsame RNG Advance. This means the two Pokémon Nature, IVs,\nAbility, Gender, and Shiny Status, for the most part.\n\nWhile rare, sometimes a Pokémon the same RNG Advance will spawn\nwith a different Method. This keeps the Pokémons PIDs the same,\nbut their IVs will be different. Is this a clone? Are the other ones\nclones? Does it even matter?\n\nWell, that's entirely personal. Not only is it possible for this to\nhappen entirely naturally, it's actually very likely to. If you're\nplaying without Manips on Emerald or Dead Battery Ruby &amp;\nSapphire, the game's RNG is not functioning properly anyway. You\ncan and will hit the same RNG Advance, randomly, without knowing\nit.\n\nNo Official legality checks have ever cared about these types of\n\"clones\", and neither has anything in-game. So they are all 100% safe to\ntransfer.\n\nI have had a lot of fun playing the game this way, doing many shiny only\nnuzlockes or playthroughs. But, if you find this gets stale, do not\nworry, late into the Intermediate and Advanced guide sections,\nwe will be covering ways around this.*\n\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Static Manip!\nStatic Manip\nTo get started with the Static Manip, you want to save in-front of\nwhichever Pokémon you want to receive. Here I am in front of Rayquaza.\n\n  Note: Castform, Kyogre, Groudon, Lileep, Anorith &amp; Roaming Latios / Latias\n  These five Pokémon have slightly unique save positions and requirements\nthan the rest of the Static encounters.\n\nCastform: Castform is given to you after you defeat Team Aqua or\nMagma in the Weather Institute, directly after a battle. If you party is full, it will go directly to your PC. The only way to make the scientist give it to you later is by having a full party &amp; an entirely full PC. \n\nKyogre &amp; Groudon: These Legendaries have text which is triggered by\na Step Forward rather than an A Press. Save one step away from\nthis tile.\n\nLileep &amp; Anorith: The two fossils are generated when you receive\nthem from the Scientist, not when you give them to him. So first you\nmust give him your fossil, then walk out of the building so he finishes\nreviving them, and walk back to him and save the game.\n\nLatios/Latias: The roaming Pokemon is generated like a normal static*\nwhen you select the color on the TV. In R/S/FR/LG the Roaming Pokemon is bugged\nto have horrible IVs. But this is fixed in Emerald! \n\nCatching the roamer is quite annoying, but you can read about the best way to do it\nhere, in the R/S Roamer guide.\nThose games get a separate guide just because of the aforementioned glitch.\n\n\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 1748. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nYou don't need to touch Refresh Interval or Precision\nCalibration.\nWe are almost ready to begin. You need to know three more things.\n\nWHEN to encounter the Pokémon. Usually it's the final text box\n\nbefore receipt / encounter.\n\n\nIF there is text at all.\n\n\nWHAT to press to encounter the Pokémon, if there is no text.\nUsually it's A or Up, and if you're pressing Up, make sure to save ONE TILE away from when the\nencounter triggers.\n\n\nHere is a list so you can be certain of when to Press A or Up, and if\nthere is text.\n\n  List: When to Encounter\n  \n\nTreecko: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nTorchic: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nMudkip: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nLileep: The fossil was an ancient POKéMON.

I hope you'll walk plenty with this here EGG!\n\n\nBeldum: Take the POKé BALL? YES/NO\n\n\nChikorita: So you'll take the CHIKORITA? YES/NO\n\n\nCyndaquil: So the CYNDAQUIL is your choice?

YES/NO\n\n\nKecleon (Route 119,120): The startled POKéMON attacked!\n\n\nVoltorb (New Mauville): Press A in front of it\n\n\nElectrode (Team Aqua Hideout): Press A in front of it\n\n\nSudowoodo (Battle Frontier): The weird tree attacked!\n\n\nRegirock: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRegice: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRegisteel: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRoaming Lati@s: Press A on the Red/Blue option on the TV.\n\n\nLatias (Southern Island): Press A in front of it\n\n\nLatios (Southern Island): Press A in front of it\n\n\nKyogre: Press UP while facing up\n\n\nGroudon: Press UP while facing up\n\n\nRayquaza: Press A in front of it\n\n\nDeoxys: Press A in front of it\n\n\nMew: Press A in front of it\n\n\nLugia: Press A in front of it\n\n\nHo-oh: Press UP while facing up\n\n\nList compiled by ZSpica\n\nIf the Pokémon you are manipping says Press A in front of it, or\nPress UP while facing it, click the \"No Text Box\" tab.\n\nText Box\n At this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the pretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nIf your Pokémon HAS text boxes in the list above, talk to whatever NPC /\nEncounter you're in and get to the final box of dialogue. Then, wait\nthere until Eon Timer finishes counting down. Pictured Below is what\nwaiting for Sudowoodo looks like:\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\n \nNo Text Box\n \nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the pretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nIf your Pokémon DOES NOT have dialogue, press Start to bring up the\nMenu. This will freeze any NPCs nearby, who may cause extra unwanted\nRNG Advancements. Dialogue boxes do this naturally, so those Static\nPokémon do not need this extra step. Pictured below is how I wait for\nRayquaza.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. On the 3rd beep Press B to Close the Menu, and on the\n6th beep, when the timer finishes, Press A or Press Up to\nstart the encounter.\n \n\n\nAnd we can see it's not shiny like I wanted. It's likely you also missed\nyour target. We're going to have to check the Pokémons summary screen to\nfigure out what RNG Advance we landed on. To do that, we'll have to\ncatch it if it's an encounter.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you are aiming for a Shiny and didn't get\none, just use the Masterball for a catch if you have it. You will not be\nkeeping the Pokémon, so it just speeds the process up.\nOnce you can view the Pokémons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nStatic Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 1748. So I set it to 748. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 2748. This will generate Pokémon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nThen, set Shininess back to Any. All IVs should also be 0 to 31. Set Nature to what the Pokemon you received had.  In my case it's a Brave Rayquaza, who has no\nGender.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokémon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokémon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, hit the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target. In my case, I only got one possibility near me.\nIf you have no results at all, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\n\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the\nAdvance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The\ncalibration will change, and you can try again.\n\nNow repeat the process from Static Manip until you get your desired\nPokémon.\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokémon you are\naiming for. The Raqyuaza for this guide took me 3 attempts, including\nthe first adjustment run.\n\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  If on the attempt after your adjustment run, you find you're only one\nor two Advances off, try not adjusting. 1 Advance is only 16\nmilliseconds, well within the margin of human error.\n\nOn the contrary, if you find yourself dancing around it, consistently\nbeing 1 Advance early or late several times, try adjusting anyway.\nSometimes breaking out of the cycle, even if it makes you more late or\nearly, can help!\n\nLastly, have patience! This is a skill to hone, maybe it takes you 10,\n15 tries now. But a couple weeks from now, maybe 5! Hope you're having\nfun!\n\nNext Steps...\nIf you enjoyed this process and want to do more RNG Manips, I would\nsuggest moving on to Wild RNG. While the general process and structure\nof the manip (Wait for timer, push button at right time) is not\ndifferent, finding what Advance you landed on is slightly more\nchallenging. Once you have Wild RNG Mastered, you'll be able to take on\nsome more difficult manips.\n","description":"Guide to RNG Manip basic Static Encounters in Pokemon Emerald","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/emerald-static/","title":"Emerald Static Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/emerald-wild/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter RNG Manipping your first Static Pokemon, you may be looking for\nsome variety. Look no further than basic wild rng manips. While the\ngeneral process is the same as Static (Start timer, Press A when done),\nyou have a much wider variety of targets, and searching for what\nAdvance you landed on is more difficult.\nWild RNG includes anywhere you can randomly find Pokemon by walking.\nThis includes Grass, Surfing, Diving, &amp; Caves. I will be\nexcluding the Safari Zone from this guide, it is slightly more\nchallenging for various reasons, and will be covered in our\nIntermediate section.\nWith that said, once you have mastered Static &amp; Wild RNG Manips,\nyou should move on to some more difficult manips.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Emerald(any language)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, or a GBA\nEmulator\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nSave at the location directly in-front of whichever Pokemon you wish\nto capture or receive.\n\n\nAny Pokemon with the move Sweet Scent. The earliest available\nuser in Emerald is Oddish on route 110. It is available after 1\nbadge, but you need to deliver the letter to Steven in Dewford and\nthe Parts to Captain Stern.\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\nPokeballs to capture it, if it's a capture. (Master Ball\npreferred)\n\n\nPokemon to aid in capture, such as a false swipe user or a\nsleep user.\n\n\n5-10 Rare Candies. (Not 100% Needed, but helpful).\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\nTen Lines\n\n\nEon Timer 3.0.0-rc.6\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nim a blisy ._. \nDisclaimer: The video above showcases the same process as this text guide, but with different tools \n\nThe Guide\nPick your target\nThe first thing we have to do is pick our target Pokémon. Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Emerald Painting Seed. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a Nintendo DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 0000, this is the default seed for Emerald. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, we cover how to find it here.\n\n\n  Note: Sweet Scent Offset?\n  In our Static RNG Guide, I covered why we do not list offsets\nanymore. But you may be wondering why not cover Sweet Scents\nOffset, since it should be the same everywhere?\n\nThe reason is because Sweet Scent's offset changes based on which\narea you are in, and what game you are in. And again, learning how to\ncalibrate after missing your Target once is an important step in the\nprocess.\n\nIn short- Don't stress about Offset. It's not useful to us, learning\nhow to Calibrate will teach you how to handle delays.\n\nFor Method, Select Wild 2.\n\n  Note: What are Methods?\n  Methods result in different sets of IVs for a Pokemon, from the same RNG\nAdvance. However, they have the same PID, which means they will still be\nShiny and have the same Nature.\n\nWhich Method you get on a Wild Pokemon in Emerald is, for the most part, controlled by the lead of your party.\n\nIf you have an egg as the lead of your party, it will mostly be Method Wild 1. \n\nIf you have no special lead, it will most likely be Method Wild 2.\n\nSpecial leads like Syncronize can cause the Method to change to any of the 3, depending on your lead Pokemons Personality ID.\n\nFor this guide, because we are just teaching you how to get a quick shiny, don't stress on the methods. We'll cover how to manipulate them in greater detail in our Advanced section. Just keep in mind that you can hit all 3 when you try to find what advance you landed on.\n\nNext, think of what Pokemon you want to RNG\nManip, because its Species, Location, &amp; Category will all\nbe important to this section.\nFirst is Category. We can choose\nbetween Grass &amp; Surfing. Functionally, they are the same, but\nthey have different Locations available to them. The Fishing Rods &amp; Rock Smash will be covered in our Intermediate guides.\nAfter we select Category, we will select our Location in-game where we want to catch our Pokemon.\nThen, we select our Pokemon in the Pokemon Dropdown. In addition, check the Filter box. This will tell Ten Lines to only search for that species.\nIf you have a special Lead, like Syncronize, set it in the Lead drop down. I didn't use one, so I left it as None.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you want. And also select if you want a Shiny.\n\nI will just be aiming for a simple Shiny Oddish on Route 121.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce all your fields are set, click Submit. You should get several results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Wild RNG is not the same as Static\nRNG in the sense that you will always have the same targets\navailable to you. Sometimes trainer IDs may produce multiple shiny\ntargets of different species on nearby Advances. So I encourage you\nto leave the Pokemon Dropdown blank to see if you have any other\nTargets.\nThis Trainer ID unfortunately only has Advance 7146 available as a\nShiny, which, while being a different Advance, is the same PID &amp;\nIVs as our Starter / Static targets. You probably have the same\nPID as your starter available to you, but you also may not. It's up to you to\ninvestigate.\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokemon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time. There are ways to\ncircumvent this issue, but they are difficult techniques covered in our\nAdvanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have none, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, Different Species, or\nChange Routes if your Pokemon is available on another one.\nI will be aiming for Advance 7146.\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Wild Manip!\nWild Manip\nTo get started with the Wild Manip, you want to save in-front in the\nLocation you want to RNG Manip in. Here is me saved on Route 121.\nYour area in the Location does not matter.\nAlso MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A POKEMON WITH SWEET SCENT IN YOUR PARTY. In\nmy case, I am using Oddish. You can use any Pokemon with that move.\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 7146. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nYou don't need to touch Refresh Interval or Precision\nCalibration.\nWe are all ready to begin!\nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nGet to the overworld, and press Start to bring up the Menu. This\nwill freeze any NPCs nearby, who may cause extra unwanted RNG\nAdvancements.\n\nThen, head into your Pokemon Menu. Press A on your Sweet Scent user,\nand hover over the Sweet Scent option.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter\nusing Sweet Scent.\n\nAnd we can see not only is the Pokemon not shiny, it's not even the\ncorrect species.\nIt's likely you also missed your target. We're going to have to check\nthe Pokemons summary screen to figure out what RNG Advance we landed\non. To do that, we'll have to catch it.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you are aiming for a Shiny and didn't get\none, just use the Masterball for a catch if you have it. You will not be\nkeeping the Pokemon, so it just speeds the process up.\nOnce you can view the Pokemons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nWild Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 7146. So I set it to 6146. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 1000 above your target. So again, in my case, this is 8146. \nThis will generate Pokemon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nChange the Pokemon to the species you\ncaught.\nThen, set Shininess back to Any. All IVs should also be 0 to 31. Set Nature to what the Pokemon you received had. In my case it's an Impish Shuppet.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, push the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit.

In my case, I only got one possibility near me.\nIf you have no results at all, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\nIf you get no results after that, there is always the chance you hit\na Different Method. While rare, it can happen. Be sure to check\nMethods Wild 1, and Wild 4 if you get no results for\nTHOUSANDS of Advances.\n\n\n  Note: Two identical results\n  Finding the correct Advance you landed on can be difficult if you\ndo not have the ability to level up your Pokemon &amp; it is a low level\nencounter. Sometimes, you will end up with a situation like this:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it's impossible to tell which Oddish I received.\nThey are IDENTICAL. When this is the case, repeat the steps from\nWild Manip until you land on a Target where you get only one\nresult. This is not common, but it can happen.\n\nAlso, make sure you're looking at all the details. Species &amp;\nLevel can be different while all else is identical. Just keep it in\nmind.\n\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the\nAdvance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The\ncalibration will change, and you can try again.\n\nNow repeat the process from Wild Manip until you get your desired\nPokemon.\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. The Oddish for this guide took me 5 attempts, including the\nfirst adjustment run.\n\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  Remember to always check other wild methods when searching for what target you hit!\nIf you find your results don't make sense, that could be the key!\n\nIn addition, really make sure to check your Lead Ability. If you have one on, but\ndidn't mean to, it'll cause your results to vary wildly!\n\nThis is really not that different from the Static RNG you should've done!\n\nNext Steps...\nCongratulations! You've finished all the Beginner RNG Manips for\nEmerald! At this point, I'd suggest delving into some more\ncomplicated subjects in our Intermediate section, or trying\nPokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire, which is very similar to this.\nIntermediate will contain a lot of familiar techniques showcased\nhere, but with various different challenges. Things like\nFishing, Rock Smash, The Safari Zone are all more\nchallenging than these manips, while still being \"Press A at Right\nMoment\". It's other things that complicate them.\nAdvanced will contain extremely challenging manips with Multiple\nFrame Perfect Inputs, for those who want to go the extra mile to gain\nPerfect IV Shiny Pokemon / Very Rare Pokemon. Things like Painting\nRNG, Egg RNG, &amp; Battle Record.\n","description":"Guide to RNG Manip basic Sweet Scent Encounters in Pokemon Emerald","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/emerald-wild/","title":"Emerald Wild Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/introduction/":{"body":"\nPokemon Emerald might be the BEST game to RNG Manip in of all time. Gamefreak made a huge blunder and forgot to program in a way for the game to determine the initial seed in this game.\nThat means the random number generator always starts from the same point. 0. This is great for learning how to manip, because you can learn your trainer ID and secret ID, then repeat the same target multiple times for shinies!\nUnlike RS, this game doesn’t need a dead battery either! All emerald cartidges can easily RNG Manip with a live battery, so you can have your berries and manip too!\nOur beginner section will teach you this. However, this becomes stale after a while. And on top of that, what if you want a Pokemon who isn’t one of your shiny targets? \nWell, this is why Emerald is the best! Thanks to its combination of advanced techniques like Painting, Battle Record, and Lead Abilities, we have not only a high degree of control around what Pokemon we can catch, but unbelievable levels of consistency.\nRS &amp; FRLG do have similar levels of control around getting different targets to spawn, but those both require at least 2 frame perfect inputs! Emerald will never need more than 1.\nOn top of all of this, Emerald has the highest variety of available target Pokemon thanks to its expanded Pokedex, map, and numerous event areas. \nAnd the final thing we can’t forget about is glitches, if you’re interested! The Pomeg Glitch &amp; Arbitrary Code Execution. These glitches allow you to expand and customize your specific cartridge however you like.\nJust want to unlock old events? Done. \nChange your TID/SID to get new shiny frames? Done. \nWant to freeze the RNG and change the RNG Seed? Done. \nWant to build a fully custom Pokemon using a hex editor inside of the game? Done.\nI tend to not do some of the crazier stuff, but it’s all about feel. What’s fun for you, and does it enhance your playthrough?\nAll of these things combined make Emerald a perfect game to learn how to manip on, and then by the time you want to dive deep and really get into the weeds of it, no game will have more depth &amp; variety than it. \nIf you’re ready to get started, head on over to our starter guide!\n-- im a blisy ._.\n","description":"An introduction to what Emerald RNG is!","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/introduction/","title":"Emerald RNG Manip Introduction"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/beginner/starter-rng/":{"body":"Overview\nThe first step of learning to manipulate the RNG of Pokémon Emerald\nbegins with the Starter.\nOnce successful, you'll have both a Shiny Starter Pokémon and know your\nSecret ID for manipulating future Shiny Pokémon. It should be noted that\nyou cannot control your TID or SID with this method, but instead are\nusing your TID and a Shiny Starter to deduce your Secret ID.\nRecommended Setup\n\nPokémon Emerald (any language)\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\nTools Used\n\n\nTen Lines\n\n\nJS-Finder IDs\n\n\nEon Timer 3.0.0-rc.6\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nPokémon Trainer Choppy \nim a blisy ._. \nDislcaimer: These video examples showcase the same process, but with different tools\n\nThe Guide\nNew Game Timer\nThe first step to getting a shiny starter is to start a New Game, and\nget to the Name Entry screen.\nAfter entering your desired name, open EonTimer, click the Gen 3 tab,\nmake sure Calibration is 0 and Timer is set to 950 frames.\n\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nPretimer is optional.\n\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the 950\nframe timer.\n\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown allowing you to\ntime the A-press to leave the naming screen.\n\n\nOnce everything is set up correctly, advance to the next screen and\nstart EonTimer at the same time.\nThe goal is to press A with the 6th beep on this text box:\n\n\nThis will cause the game to advance to the Inside of the Truck, at which\npoint, you can open your Trainer Card and check your Trainer ID.\nFinding Potential SIDs\nThe Trainer ID was set immediately upon leaving the Naming Screen.\n\nEmerald used this Trainer ID to seed the RNG, which then determines your\nSecret ID.\n\nUpon pressing A at the final text box of the intro cutscene, the Secret\nID is locked in 50 RNG advances later.\n\n\n  Note: Frames Vs Advances\n  Frames and Advances are often used interchangeably across RNG documentation, guides, and tools.\n\nFrames is a commonly used term to describe game-state intervals in Speedrunning and Fighting Games. Updating video game logic every visual frame is a common practice, and this is generally how it works Generation 3, but not always\n\nHowever, in later games this isn’t always the case. The frames you visually see might be completely separate from the game’s logic. RNG Advances accurately describes what’s happening, no matter the situation.\n\nBy setting EonTimer's Target Frame to 950, we hope to land on the\nSecret ID exactly 1000 Frames after the TID was set.\n\nWe can view all of these potential SIDs using the IDs section in\nJS-Finder.\n\n\nIn order to view Secret ID results you must match the following settings.\nYour TID is used as your Initial Seed, which must be input in Hexadecimal.\nFor example, a Trainer ID of 16804 becomes 41A4 in Hexadecimal.\nTo get your Initial Seed, type your Trainer ID into the box below and hit convert. It will switch it to a Hexadecimal Representation. \n\n\n\n\n    Convert\n\n        \n        \n    \n\t\t\n\nInput your Initial Seed you just converted into the Initial Seed box. \nThen, set Initial Advances to 990, and Max Advances to 10,000.\nNow, hit Generate.\n\nThe given settings will generate all of the potential Secret IDs in the\n\"SID\" column from Advance 990 onward.\nAnything in the TID Column should be IGNORED. It's okay that they do not match YOUR TID.\nAdvance 1000 was our target so, assuming your last A-press on the intro\nsequence was frame perfect, this would be your Secret ID.\n\nDo not exit this window, it's a list of Secret IDs from 995 to 1005. In the event you didn't hit\nthe Secret ID on Advance 1000, then you can check the others.\nIn our example, Advance 1000 would be SID 05610. The next step is\nattempting to RNG a Shiny Starter Pokémon, assuming this Secret ID is\ncorrect.\nStarter Timer\nNow that we know our first potential Trainer ID and Secret ID, we'll be\nusing Ten Lines and EonTimer together.\nOpen the Ten Lines website, and click the Calibration tab.\n\n\nWe now need to find the closest Shiny Starter available using our TID &amp; our first potential SID.\nTo do this, we need to set up the Calibration tab appropriately.\nGame should be set to Emerald Painting Seed. Painting refers to a more complex technique that will be covered in our Advanced Section, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nConsole is whatever you're playing on. For this guide, I was using a Nintendo DS. \nTarget Seed should be set to 0000. This is because\nEmerald's RNG is coded incorrectly.\n\nDuring the New Game process, our Trainer ID was also the RNG seed.\nHowever, after resetting, it always defaults back to seed 0000.\n\nUnlike Ruby &amp; Sapphire, this has nothing to do with the cartridge's\nbattery, it is a coding error.\n\nSeed+/- is 0. This is used to see adjacent seeds to our target. We currently will only be able to hit 1 seed, though, so we want to see nothing adjacent to our target.\nMinimum Advances is set to 0, but getting past the title screen and\nloading into the game will always take at least 10 seconds. This means\nany Shiny below 600 is likely impossible to hit.\n\nMaximum Advances is set to 10,000, which takes 166.67 seconds or just\nunder 3 minutes of waiting. You can increase this number if you get no\nresults.\nOffset should be set to 0. \nMethod should be left at Static 1. \nCategory should be starters, and then for Pokemon select the starter you want to manip.\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\n\nOnce you've matched these settings in the calibration tab, click\nSubmit.\n\n\nFor our example TID\\SID, the nearest Shiny starter is 8131 RNG advances\nafter the game starts, and so we can set Target Frame in EonTimer to\n8131.\n\n\nFirst Attempt\nWe're now ready to progress the story in-game, up until the point where\nyour character is standing in front of the Starter bag.\n\n\nSave the game right here in this spot, and then use A+B+START+SELECT\nto Soft Reset and Start EonTimer. (If using PreTimer, then\nyou'll do the Soft Reset after the 5 second countdown.)\nSkip past all of the intro cutscenes as fast as possible, and then wait\non this screen for your desired starter Pokémon.\n\n\nThe final A-press is on YES. Wait until the 6th Beep in EonTimer,\npress A, and then go to POKéMON in battle to open the Summary of your\nPokémon and check the Stats and Nature.\n\n\nThe next step is to plug these stats into the Ten Lines and determine how\nclose the attempt was to the target RNG Advance of 8131.\nAdjustment\nBefore we calculate our stats, we want to change some settings in Calibration so we can search effectively.\nWe want to change Initial Advances to be about 50 before our target, and Maximum Advances to about 50 after.\nIn the example, I was aiming for 8131 and set Initial Advances to\n8100. And I set Maximum Advances to 8200.\nThis ensures that you don't get too many matches, and are only searching\nfor Pokémon near your target. Since the Starter is only Level 5,\nsearching too large of a range will result in false positives that\naren't actually the Pokémon you hit.\n\nInput the Nature of the Pokémon, and then set the\nShiny dropdown to Any.\n\n\nWhen you do that, the IV Calculator will appear.\n\nIn it, input your Pokémons Level &amp; Stats. If the bar where you enter them turns red, that means you made a typo or forgot to enter something.\n\nOnce the settings are correct, click Submit to check for matches.\nIf you don't get any matches, then gradually expand the range by\nlowering Initial Advances, and increasing Maximum Advances.\n\n\n\nThe Bashful Mudkip received on the first attempt was 8129, which is\n2 advances early compared to the target of 8131. EonTimer's\nCalibration function allows us to automatically adjust the timer for\nthis difference.\n\nEnter 8129 into the Frame Hit box, and click Update.\n\n\nCalibration will update with a number of milliseconds equal to the\ndifference between your Target Frame and the Frame Hit. In the\nexample, Calibration becomes 33 after clicking update, because we\nwere 2 frames early. At 60 frames per second, each frame lasts 16.66667\nmilliseconds.\nFrom here, the goal is to try again using this timer, until you've hit\nthe Starter on your Target Frame.\nAs a rule of thumb, once you start being off by 1 advance either\nabove-or-below the target you can stop adjusting EonTimer. 16.666\nmilliseconds is a very small amount of time, and well within the margins\nof human error.\nEventually, you'll hit the Target Frame and the IVs and\nNature will match, but it will not be Shiny.\n\n\nThis means that you were not frame perfect on your Secret ID A-Press\nwhen exiting the Intro Cutscene earlier, and that's okay! In our\nexample, this means our Secret ID was not 05610.\n\nThis is why it's recommended to save the list of potential Secret IDs\nthat are near 1000.\nRather than starting a New Game and trying to hit Advance 1000 again,\nyou can instead change Secret ID in the Ten Lines to one of the nearby ones. In\nthis example, I moved to Advance 1001, which is Secret ID 23976.\nThe process for checking this Secret ID is the same as the first. You'll\nwant to reset the Calibration Tab back to how it was when searching\nfor the nearest Shiny Advance in Starter Timer\n\n\nWith the new Secret ID of 23976 in place, the next potential Shiny\nStarter is on Advance 3138.\n\nRepeat the cycle of:\n\n\nChange SID in Calibration\nSearch for Nearest Shiny Starter\nMake Attempt and Calculate Stats\nAdjust EonTimer\nRepeat Attempts Until Stats \\ Nature Match\nIf not Shiny, return to Step 1...\nUntil...\n\n\n\nFailure Conditions\nIt's absolutely possible to get your Shiny Starter after checking only 1\nor 2 SIDs. However, it entirely depends on how accurately the timer was\nhit during the intro cutscene, and whether or not errors were made.\n\nIt's fairly common for first timers to check 5 or more SIDs without\nseeing a Shiny. It can be frustrating, but DON'T GIVE UP.\n\nHowever, as a general rule, I don't recommend checking beyond the\nrange of 995 to 1005. If the Intro portion is done correctly, it's very\nunlikely to be more than 5 advances off.\n\nIn the event you've verified your Secret ID is definitely not between\n995 to 1005, it's a good idea to start a New Game and try hitting\nAdvance 1000 on a new Trainer ID.\n\nIt's a bit of a gamble either way. You could be one extra SID check away\nfrom your Shiny, or you might have made a mistake in the Intro Sequence\nand wind up checking 20 SIDs with no Shiny.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, once you see a Shiny Starter and your Secret\nID is confirmed, RNG manipulating the rest of the game is now available\nto you.\nNext Steps...\nWith the Starter &amp; TID/SID Manip out of the way, you're ready to move on to the next steps!\nEither Static or Wild Manips will do, although, Wild is slightly more challenging.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Emerald Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 0000, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields.\n\n\nFor Method, select Wild 2.\nSet Category to Rock Smash.\nFor the Location, you should select the one that has the Pokemon you\nwant to RNG Manip. There's only four available from Rock Smash in\nEmerald, so I'll list them out here.\nIf you want Nosepass, choose Granite Cave BF2.\nIf you want Shuckle, choose Safari Zone Northeast.\nGeodude is in every location on this list except Safari Zone\nNortheast, and Graveler is only in Victory Road BF1.\nAfter your location is selected, select which Pokemon you want from the\ndropdown menu.\nIf you are using one of the Leads that affects encounter slots,\nselect it from that dropdown. This is Cute Charm, Magnet Pull,\nStatic, Hustle, Vital Spirit, Pressure, &amp;,\nSynchronize. A Pokemon in the lead slot of the party with one of\nthese abilities can affect the encounter slots, so make sure to take it\ninto consideration.\nI will be using a Pokemon with the ability Synchronize &amp; a Modest\nNature.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature, you want. And also select if you want a Shiny.\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny.\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokemon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time.\n\nYou can try altering your Lead Pokemon Ability, as that may change\nwhat Pokemon spawn. Here is what my list looks like when I do NOT have a\nModest Synchronizer.\n\n\nAs we can see, no Nosepass! So it's required I use Syncronize if I want a Shiny Nosepass.\nThere are other ways to circumvent this issue, but they are difficult\ntechniques covered in our Advanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have none, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, no shiny, etc.\nI will be aiming for Advance 2061.\n\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Rock Smash Manip!\nRock Smash Manip\nTo get started with Rock Smash RNG Manips we need to head to our targets\nlocation &amp; destroy every rock but 1. In my case, I am going for\nNosepass, so we'll head to BF2 of Granite Cave.\n\nHere you can see what the area typically looks like.\n\nAnd here is what it looks like after I finished prepping.\n\nI even broke the rocks that are off screen.\n\n\n  Note: Spinning NPCs\n  Typically NPCs do not interfere much with basic &amp; intermediate RNG\nManips in Emerald. And even if they did, there is not much you\ncan do about them. But, for Rock Smash, NPCs can be active &amp; moving\nduring the animation, and each Rock Smash rock counts as an NPC who\nspins in a random direction.\n\nThere's several interaction objects that do this, and you should do your\nbest to remove them from the screen if you can.\n\nThe list is as follows: Rock Smash Rocks, Strength Boulders, Cut Trees,\nVisible Items (shaped like Pokeballs), and Invisible Kecleons.\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 2061. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nAlso make sure to double check your console in EonTimers settings!\n\n\nI selected NDS - Slot 2, since I am doing this on a DS. But if you're on\na GBA, Gameboy Player, or GBA Emulator, select GBA.\nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nWhile Eon Timer counts down, immediately talk to the Rock and use Rock\nSmash. Go through the dialogue and wait on the X used ROCK SMASH.\nDialogue box, which is the final one.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\n\nYou most likely got no encounter! So, what do we do about this?\n\n\nThis is the challenging part. What we have to do is increment our target\nadvance by a random amount until we hit ANY Pokemon. That will give\nus enough intel to do our calibration.\n\nYou can go by 1, by 16, any arbitrary number. We're changing the Target\nFrame box in Eon Timer for this.\n\nI went up by 1, and on Advance 2062 I saw a non-shiny Nosepass! This is\npretty lucky. Sometimes you need to go up by hundreds of advances.\n\nOnce we get a Pokemon, we need to catch it. After that, we're going to\nhave to check the Pokemons summary screen to figure out what RNG\nAdvance we landed on.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you have one, just use the Masterball for this\ncatch. You will not be keeping the Pokemon, so it just speeds the\nprocess up.\nOnce you can view the Pokemons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nRock Smash Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 2061. So I set it to 1061. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 3061. This will generate Pokemon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nSelect which Pokemon you received. In my case it's Nosepass. Also be sure to keep the Filter Box checked so Ten Lines only searches for that species.\nAll IVs should be 0 to 31, and the shininess of the drop down should say\nAny. Set Nature to what the Pokemon\nyou received had. In my case it's a Gentle, Nosepass.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, push the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target.\nIf nothing comes up, make sure to check the other wild Methods.\nIf you still have no results, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\nIn my case, I found this Nosepass on Wild 2.\n\n\nNow we need to calibrate. You may notice this is quite a distance away\nfrom your target! I had 2062 in EonTimer, but this Nosepass spawned\non 2246! That's a 184 Advance difference. So, what we'll do is\nput that into the Offset box in Ten Lines. Then, we'll clear all our\nfields except for Shiny, which we'll set back to\nStar/Square.\nChange the Pokemon back your target species, but keep\nLocation &amp; Encounter the same.\nChange Method back to Wild 2 if you have to, leave\nSeed as 0000, change Initial Advances back to 0, and\nMaximum Advances back to 100,000.\nThen click Submit!\n\nYou'll see the same target Pokemon you aimed for earlier, but the\nAdvances are different! This is our new target we'll put into Eon\nTimer.\n\nNow repeat the process from Rock Smash Manip.\nIf you get no Pokemon spawn, just go up or down an Advance in your\nEonTimer target until you spawn something consistently.\nYou can see in Ten Lines, if you set shiny to any &amp; look around your\ntarget, that not every advance spawns a Pokemon.\n\n\nSo, just go up or down until you hit a Pokemon. We should be pretty\nclose to our target this time, however.\nIf you get a Pokemon &amp; it's not shiny, we can repeat the calibration\nstep. Catch a Pokemon, calculate its IVs, and find where you landed.\n\n\nWe can see here that I hit 2 Advances late, but on Method Wild 4. So I'm\nclose!\n\nThis time, put what you hit into EonTimers Frame Hit box rather than\ndoing the more complicated adjustments we did earlier. Click update, and\ntry again!\n\n\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. This is a bit more tedious than other manips. Nosepass took\nme around 32 minutes to get with this methodology.\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  If on the attempt after your adjustment run, you find you're only one\nor two Advances off, try not adjusting. 1 Advance is only 16\nmilliseconds, well within the margin of human error.\n\nOn the contrary, if you find yourself dancing around it, consistently\nbeing 1 Advance early or late several times, try adjusting anyway.\nSometimes breaking out of the cycle, even if it makes you more late or\nearly, can help!\n\nLastly, have patience! This is a skill to hone, maybe it takes you 10,\n15 tries now. But a couple weeks from now, maybe 5! Hope you're having\nfun!\n\nNext Steps...\nIf you enjoyed this process and want to do more RNG Manips, I would\nsuggest moving on to the Safari Zone!\nThere, we'll teach you how to take advantage of the Battle Record. An intermediate technique that teaches you how to hit RNG Advances that are typically unreachable...\n","description":"Guide to RNG Rock Smash Encounters in Pokemon Emerald","id":"https://retailrng.com/emerald/intermediate/emerald-rock-smash/","title":"Emerald Rock Smash Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/emerald/intermediate/emerald-safari-zone/":{"body":"Overview\nWhile learning RNG Manips in Emerald, you may have noticed that,\ngenerally, the process is the same for everything. Save the game, reset,\ntry and get your target.\nBut there's certain areas in the game that you cannot do this in, most\nnotable of which is the Safari Zone! In Emerald, the extensions grant\nyou the ability to catch a lot of Pokemon that are pretty rare in gen 3.\nYou might think the technique to Manip here would be to save outside the\nSafari Zone &amp; run to your desired location. However, running over grass\ntiles &amp; randomly moving NPCs will cause you to have inconsistent\nresults.\nWe have a solution, though! And it's the Battle Record feature from the\nenhanced trainer card you get once you reach the Battle Frontier.\nThis tutorial will serve as a basic use case for this feature, which\nwill let you hit target Pokemon that would otherwise seem unfeasible to\nRNG Manip, or difficult to get in cases where you cannot save.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Emerald\n\n\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA Emulator\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nEnter the Battle Frontier once so you have the Battle Frontier\nTrainer Card.\n\n\nA Pokemon with Sweet Scent\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\n5-10 Rare Candies.

If you don't have yours, we cover how to find it here.\n\nSet Method to Wild 2.\nBefore we change our anything else, we need to decide on a Target\nPokemon. I will be aiming for a Shiny Heracross.\nFor Category. I will be\nchoosing Grass in this example, since that is where Heracross\nis, but the Safari Zone has Grass, Surf, Rock Smash &amp;\nFishing available.\n\nThe Safari Zone also has several zones, it's not just one location\nin Ten Lines. Below is a\nvisual of which zone is which.\n\n\nSelect your location the Ten Lines, then select your target Pokemon\nfrom the dropdown menu. Check the Filter box in Ten Lines, next to your Pokemon. This will make sure Ten Lines only searches for that species.\nI will not be using any Lead in this guide. But if you're using Cute\nCharm, Synchronize, Hustle, or any other Lead ability, set it as well.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you want. And also select if you want a Shiny.\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny.\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\nYou might notice that for Heracross, a rare Pokemon, we got quite a lot\nof available targets! That's because we expanded Maximum Advances to be\n5 times higher than normal.\nI will be aiming for Advance 162,770. This is roughly a 45~ minute\nwait.\nThere is an earlier Heracross available, but it has the ability\nSwarm, which I don't like.\nIt might seem crazy at first to wait 45 minutes per attempt, but this is\nwhere the Battle Record feature comes into play!\nOnce we set it up, we only have to do this wait once!\nWhat is a Battle Record?\nSo what is a Battle Record anyway? Once you beat Pokemon Emerald you\ngain access to the Battle Frontier. And the first time you enter it,\nyour trainer card gets upgraded to the Frontier Pass. So now, when you\nclick on your trainer name in the start menu you'll see this screen.\n\nBattle Record is a selectable option on the Frontier Pass that lets\nyou view a replay of a battle that you had, either in multiplayer versus\nanother player using Emerald, or from a battle versus an NPC in the\nFrontier.\nThis replay isn't a video, though, it's an actual battle the game is\ndoing. To save space, gamefreak stores the trainers' teams, the moves\nthey selected, and uses that data to recreate the match!\nIn order to make sure the luck is the same, the current state of the RNG\nis also stored!\nIn short, when we load a Battle Record, we set the RNG to what it\nWAS at the start of the battle!\nThis means for my 45~ minute wait Heracross, yes, I have to wait 45\nminutes ONCE, but from then on I can try as many times as I'd like\nsimply by opening the record again!\nThis can be very useful for hitting specific targets who have rare\nencounter slots. For example, Heracross here is on encounter slots 11 &amp;\n9.\n\n\nWe could use this same Battle Record for other 1% encounter Pokemon!\nYou can also use it to aim for outrageously faraway advances! I once\nwaited a month for a\nLatias.\nThere's better ways to do this now, though. But that's for the\nAdvanced section!\nNow that we understand what a Battle Record is, let's set one up!\nSetting up a Battle Record\nConsider a Battle Record similar to what soft resetting your game\ndoes-- It resets the position of the RNG. But instead of 0, it's to a\nposition we choose.\nWe can't make it exactly our target, though! Otherwise by the time the\nvideo was closed, our target advance, and therefore Pokémon, will have\npassed us by.\nWhat we have to do then is aim for an advance BEFORE our target.\nI find that around 2000~ Advances before our target is a nice sweet\nspot. If you accidently over advance, you'll have a bit of wiggle room.\nIf you are dead on, your wait is still pretty short.\nIn my case, I'm aiming for Advance 162770, so my Battle Record\ntarget will be 160770!\nOnce you know what your Battle Record Target is, set it up in Eon\nTimer.\n\nYour Eon Timer should look something like this, but with your target\nadvance instead. By this point in the tutorials, you should be\ncomfortable setting Eon Timer up on your own. If you need a\nrefresher on it, see the Beginner Courses.\nAlso make sure to double check your console in Eon Timers settings!\n\nI selected GBA, since I am doing this on a Gameboy Player.\nFor a Battle Record attempt, we want to quickly end a battle in any\nfacility without clicking Run. The quickest for this is the Battle\nTower. You can do Level 50 or Open level.\nYou can win or lose, it doesn't matter. If you win, though, you have to\nclick Retire before your next battle to end your streak.\nI bring 3 Pokemon with Explosion / Self Destruct to make sure the match\nis always over as fast as possible.\n\n\n\n  Note: Explosion Pokemon\n  Here's a few options for explosion/self desutrct Pokemon in Emerald. \n\n\n\nVoltorb / Electrode - Level 27\n\n\nBaltoy / Claydol - Level 19\n\n\nRegice / Registeel / Regirock - Move Reminder\n\n\nKoffing / Weezing - Level 17\n\n\nGeodude / Graveler - Level 21\n\n\n\nAt this point, it's time to actually get the Battle Record!\nSave in front of the Battle Tower Clerk and we can begin!\nClick Start Eon Timer, and when the pretimer finishes on the 6th\nbeep, soft reset the game.\nOnce you're in the game, talk to the clerk and mash through their\ndialogue. Go all the way up into your opponent trainer shows up, and has\ntheir dialogue. But DO NOT start the battle.\n\nIt should look like this.\nNow we wait for Eon Timer to count down! My wait is about 44 minutes. I\nrecommend doing something else during your long wait. Have you cleaned\nyour room lately?\nThen, when Eon Timer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the trainer\nbattle.\nOnce you're in the battle, do not worry about time AT ALL. You can end\nthe battle as quickly or slowly as you need.\n\nI lost the battle, so I do not need to click Retire.\nOnce you lose or click Retire, you'll be back in the Battle Tower Lobby.\nThe clerk will ask if you want to record your last battle on your\nFrontier Pass. Say YES to this.\n\nIt looks like this. Once you say yes, you also must save the game\nregularly, or your Battle Record will not stick.\nAt this point, we're done making the Battle Record! Now we have to\nattempt our target!\nBattle Record Manip\nTo get started, I'm going to head to the North Safari Zone, where\nHeracross is located! I'll also swap out my 3 exploders, since I do not\nneed them anymore.\nAlso remember to bring your Sweet Scent user with you!\n\nNow, in Eon Timer, we're going to go to the Custom Tab. Here, set\nthe Unit to Advances, and input how many Advances you\nsubtracted from your target. I did 2000.\n\nWe don't know for certain that we're 2000 advances away exactly. In\nfact, we're probably not! So our first attempt will be us trying to\nfigure out where we actually hit!\nAt this point, we're ready!\nWhat we're going to do is open the Battle Record, then, while the\nintro to the battle happens, close the Battle Record with B, and\npress Start on Eon Timer at the same time!\n\nI closed it around here. The RNG doesn't advance until a Pokemon makes\nan attack, so you don't have to rush.\nWhile Eon Timer counts down, I go to the Pokemon Menu and hover over the\nfield move sweet scent, waiting for it to finish counting down.\n\nThen, when Eon Timer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\n\nI got a non-shiny Phanpy. If you catch it, we can move on to Adjustment!\nIf not, that's fine. Just repeat from Battle Record Manip.\nBattle Record Adjustment\nTo find out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure out\nits IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nSet Minimum Advances to 0, and Maximum Advances to 4000.\nWe'll leave Seed and Method alone, but we are going to\nchange Offset to be the amount of time we waited in the Battle Tower.\nIn my case, I waited 160770 Advances. \nSelect which Pokemon you received from the Pokemon dropdown. In my case it's\nPhanpy. Also make sure the Filter box is checked so Ten Lines only searches for that species.\nAll IVs should be 0 to 31, and set Shininess to any. \nSet Nature to what your Pokemon had. In my case it's a Hardy Phanpy\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator will appear.\n\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\nYou should be used to doing this by now, if you need a refresher on how\nto more precisely calculate the IVs, re-read one of the previous\ncourses!\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target.\nIf nothing comes up, make sure to check the other wild Methods, like 1\nand 4.\nIf you still have no results, expand your search range by increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\n\nIn my case, I hit this Wild 2 Phanpy.\n\nNow we need to calibrate. You may notice this is quite a distance away\nfrom your target! I was aiming for Advance 2000 in Eon Timer, but this Phanpy spawned on\n2652! That's a 652 Advance difference.\nThis is for three reasons.\n\n\nWhen waiting 160770 Advances in the Frontier, we likely weren't frame perfect.\n\n\nThere is probably an Offset of some amount of time between pressing A to start the frontier match and the game actually recording the PRNG State.\n\n\nSweet Scent also has an additional Offset that we didn't take into account. \n\n\nPut the Advance from Ten Lines into the Hit box in Eon\nTimer. Then, click Update.\n\nYou'll notice the calibration changes!\nI would also recommend you reset the filters section of PokeFinder back\nto default values, incase you miss your Target again!\n\nNow repeat the process from Battle Record Manip &amp; Battle Record\nAdjustment\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. I tend to only adjust if I am more than 2 off, or I land on\nthe same Advanced repeatedly.\n\nHere it only took me 4 attempts once I calibrated to land on my target\nHeracross!\nAnd remember, this Battle Record is REUSABLE. I now have a\ncalibrated Eon Timer for 2000 advances away from a shiny, that I can use\nwhenever I please!\nAnd it's on encounter slots 11 &amp; 9, which are rare Pokemon! I could use\nit for Chimecho, or Volbeat, etc!\nSo use the Battle Record as much as you can &amp; get those rare Pokemon!\nNext Steps...\nAt this point you're all done with the Intermediate course! Next up is\nAdvanced. In there we'll cover some complex, multi step Manips that will\nfocus on not only getting SHINY Pokemon, but Pokemon with good stats.

This means\ncontrolling for a specific Nature, at least 5 perfect IVs, and Hidden\nPower with a specific Type and the maximum Power of 70.\nIn Beginner and Intermediate, the focus was only on finding easy-to-hit\nShiny Pokemon without concern of competitive stats or natures, but\ncontrolling for those variables requires Advanced usage of the tools and\ntechniques covered up to this point.\nIt's assumed you already understand the basic principles of RNG\nmanipulation in these games, and we'll be covering a variety of tools\nand techniques that expand the possibilities dramatically.\nBy the end, you'll have a complete understanding of how FireRed and\nLeafGreen seeding works, how we can leverage different inputs to change\nseeds, and how to to find and hit seeds that yield competitive Pokemon\nIt should be noted that whether or not a specific competitive target is\nShiny, depends entirely on your own Trainer ID and Secret ID. Because of\nGen 3's surprisingly limited selection of PID and IV combinations, it's\nentirely possible your Save File doesn't have ANY Shiny 5IV or 6IV\nPokemon available via Static or Wild RNG.\nIn this case, glitches can be used to change your Secret ID to make any\nPID Shiny, but that's a topic for another guide. Obviously, obtaining a\nnew Trainer ID and Secret ID via starting a new game or save-editing\nwould be viable alternatives as well.\nUltimately, learning everything in this guide is the key to unlocking\nthe full potential of RNG manipulation in FireRed and LeafGreen. With\nthese tools and techniques at your disposal, it's possible to hit any\nPokemon out of the 4.294 billion potential RNG states the game can\ngenerate.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements:\n\n\nPokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green (any language)\n\n\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite, Nintendo 3DS w/\nopen_agb_firm\n\n\nWindows / Mac OS / Ubuntu PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nEmpty Space in Party\n\n\nAccess to Celadon City\n\n\n5500 Game Corner Coins OR In-Game Gift Eevee (optional)\n\n\nRare Candies if Gift Target is Low Level\n\n\nSpore/False Swipe Pokemon and Balls for Capture Targets\n\n\nMaster Ball for Capture Targets (optional)\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\nTen Lines Calibration\n\n\nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc6\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nFinding a Target Seed\nThe first step in finding a viable competitive target is to identify its\n32-bit RNG seed, which is represented as 8 hexadecimal digits. (ex.\n1A2BCDEF)\n\n  Note: What's the difference between an Initial Seed and any other \nSeed\n  Up until now, we've only focused on 16-bit initial seeds, which are the\n4-digit hex numbers the game grabs from the CPU timer1 and uses as a\nstarting point for all future RNG states.\n\nAll initial seeds are just 32-bit RNG states with four leading zeroes.\nFor example, the initial seed BC75, is more accurately represented as\nRNG State 0000BC75. You can pass over multiple initial seeds during the\ncourse of normal gameplay, because all 65,536 16-bit seeds are points\ncontained within a number line starting from Advance 0 up to Advance\n4,294,967,295-- which is the maximum 32-bit value ( 2³² ).\n\nif you left your game running for 4.294 billion frames (which takes\njust over 828.5 days at 60 frames-per-second) you'd loop back around to\nthe exact RNG state used for the initial seed.\n\nThe best tool for this purpose is the Searcher tab of Lincoln's Ten Lines web tool\nIt can search all 4.294 Billion RNG States for specific IV Ranges,\nNatures, Hidden Power Types, and get the 32-bit RNG seed which generates\nthat Pokemon.\nWe'll be searching for a Jolly Aerodactyl with the best possible IVs for\nHidden Power Flying.\n(which is its best option for Flying STAB damage in Gen 3 OU)\n1. Open the tool here.\nYou'll want to be on the Searcher tab.\n2. Select your Game.\nOptional: Enter your Trainer ID and Secret ID to search for Shiny targets, but as mentioned, its very unlikely to find a Shiny Competitive spread for your randomly generated TID/SID.\n3. Set the Method to Static 1.\n4. Set your Category and Pokemon to match the Target.\n5.  Set the Nature to fit your desired Target.\n6.  Set the Hidden Power Type to match your target.\n7.  Set each of the required stats in Filters to 30 - 31.\nYou can ignore either Atk or SpA if your target only uses\nPhysical/Special.\nSet Speed to 31 - 31 if you want to ensure maximum speed. \nHowever, note that Hidden Power Fire/Fighting/Psychic/Rock cannot have 31 Speed without sacrificing another stat from being perfect.\n8.  Click SUBMIT to generate results.\n\n\nAfter clicking SEARCH Ten Lines will output a table of results,\nwith the potential Pokemon that match your desired filters. \n\nOf these results only two have my desired ability of Rock Head, which is\nthe preferred ability, as it allows Aerodactyl to use Double Edge\nwithout taking Recoil damage.\nNext, we'll compare these two potential Targets, and see which has the shortest wait time in terms of Initial Seed and Advances. \nFor that we'll need to cover...\nUsing Ten Lines Initial Seed\nTen Lines Initial Seed uses an optimized search function to take any 32-bit\nRNG state and locate the nearest known 16-bit initial seed and the\nnumber of RNG advances necessary to reach the target. \nIt provides the estimated millisecond waiting time for that seed, the total time for\neach attempt, and the required in-game settings and held buttons that\nmust be used.\nAll that's needed is to click the Initial Seed button next to your potential targets from Searcher and it will automatically switch tabs and auto-populate the relevant settings.\n\n\\Click Submit to get the 10 nearest known 16-bit initial seeds that\ncan generate your target Pokemon.\nIf you'd like to see more results, you can increase Number of\nResults, but generally these will be longer attempts.\n\nThe most important pieces of information in this output are the Est.\nTotal Time and Settings columns.\n10 minutes 48 seconds per attempt is the shortest available RNG\nmanip we could do for this particular Aerodactyl.\nThe settings for those attempts also have blackout_L and\nstartup_A which are advanced held button combos that are needed to\nmodify the initial seed. These add an extra element of variability to\neach attempt, and will be covered in the next section.\nIf you were limited to only one 32-bit seed for your target, you'd have\nto select one of these and proceed. Since we have two potential 32-bit\nSeeds for our target, it's generally good practice to compare the two.\nSo swap back to the Searcher tab and click the Initial Seed button for a different potential Target. \nIn this case, its 32-bit seed C8938938.\n\n\nThe results for this second seed are highly preferable, as the Est.\nTotal Times are all around 5 minutes.\nHowever, they also all require various different held= options.\nIn the next section, we'll cover each of these different options and how\nto properly use EonTimer and Calibration to hit them.\nPre-Calibrating Seed Timer\nBecause every attempt at our target Aerodactyl will take approximately 5\nminutes, we can use a technique known as pre-calibration to confirm\nour Seed(ms) in EonTimer more quickly.\nThis involves doing the shortest possible attempts on a repeatable\ntarget like the Gift Eevee or a Game Corner Pokemon, ignoring\nour Target Advances and focusing only on hitting our Target\nSeed.\nThis isn't strictly necessary but it has two main benefits:\n\n\nUsing Held Buttons introduces a new potential avenue for making\nmistakes. Spending 5 (or more) minutes waiting, only to get no\nresults can be frustrating. Even worse, calibrating to a false\npositive result can lead to utter confusion.\nPre-Calibration attempts take around 1 minute each, and let you\npractice and lock-in your Seed(ms) with confidence.\n\n\nOur Aerodactyl is only Level 5 on redemption, whereas these Gift\nPokemon are Level 24-25. Using higher level Pokemon for\ncalibration reduces the chance of false positives, and gives us\nthe option to do Manual Seed Lookup using Gen 3 Seed\nAssistant (if necessary).\n\n\nIf your seed is held=none, your Est. Total Time is under 2\nminutes, and your Target Pokemon is above Level 25, then it's\nreasonable to do your first attempt on the actual target instead of\npre-calibrating.\nI'll be using the Lv. 24 Dratini from the Game Corner in Leaf\nGreen for pre-calibration, which costs 4600 Coins. The Fire\nRed equivalent would be the Lv. 25 Scyther for 5500 coins.\n(If the Lv. 25 Eevee Gift is still available in Celadon City,\nthis is by far the fastest and best option.)\nMake sure to have an empty slot in your party!\n\nIf your Target Seed has a held=none option, then nothing changes\nfrom basic Static RNG Manipulation.\nReference the following tabs for each of the alternate Held\noptions, and the inputs needed to hit those seeds successfully:\n\nSTARTUP SELECT\n This is the easiest of the held button modifiers to do correctly.\nIf your target seed has Held: Startup Select in Ten Lines then\nthe process is as follows...\n\nFirst, get into position in front of the Game Corner attendant, open\nyour in-game settings and set SOUND and BUTTON MODE to\nmatch the target from The Ten Lines, then Save and Power\nOff.\nThen, open EonTimer, and go to the Custom Tab (C).\nSet Seed(ms) to your Seed Time from The Ten Lines.\nSet Advances to 800 (which should be just enough time to redeem your\nGame Corner prize.)\n\nYou're now set-up to do the Pre-Calibration run.\n1. Begin holding SELECT before booting the game.\n2. Start EonTimer, Boot the game and continue to hold SELECT through\nthe entire intro cutscene\n3. Press and hold your Button: input at the 6th beep on the Title\nScreen, without releasing SELECT\n4. Release your Button: input and the SELECT button once you see\nthe File Load screen.\n5. Load your game and redeem your Gift Pokemon on the final\nbeep.\n \nSTARTUP A\n \nThis input requires an additional modification, as the Button: input\ncan also be A.\nHowever, if Button: L or Button: Start the inputs are the same.\n\nFirst, get into position in front of the Game Corner attendant, open\nyour in-game settings and set SOUND and BUTTON MODE to\nmatch the target from The Ten Lines, then Save and Power\nOff.\nThen, open EonTimer, and go to the Custom Tab (C).\nSet Seed(ms) to your Seed Time from The Ten Lines.\nSet Advances to 800 (which should be just enough time to redeem your\nGame Corner prize.)\n\nYou're now set-up to do the Pre-Calibration run.\nOn GBA, begin holding A before flicking the power switch to boot the\ngame.\nOn DS or 3DS, press-and-hold A when booting the game.\n1. Start EonTimer, Boot the game, and continue to hold A through the\nentire intro cutscene\n2. Release A when you see the leaves or flames on the Title Screen (see\nbelow image)\n3. Press and hold your Button: input at the 6th beep on the Title\nScreen, until File Load screen appears.\n4. Release your Button: input, load your game and redeem your\nGift Pokemon on the final beep.\nHeld Button Release Window\n\n \nBLACKOUT\n \nThis covers Blackout L, Blackout R, Blackout A, and\nBlackout AL (which is A + L held together.)\n\nThese inputs take advantage of a special window during the FireRed &amp;\nLeafGreen startup sequence where the input reading function isn't\nactive. They require moderately strict timing, but are well within human\ncapability.\nFirst, get into position in front of the Game Corner attendant, open\nyour in-game settings and set SOUND and BUTTON MODE to\nmatch the target from The Ten Lines, then Save and Power\nOff.\nThen, open EonTimer, and go to the Custom Tab (C).\nSet Seed(ms) to your Seed Time from The Ten Lines.\nSet Advances to 800 (which should be just enough time to redeem your\nGame Corner prize.)\n\nYou're now set-up to do the Pre-Calibration run, but be prepared to\npress-and-hold your Blackout Buttons. The window happens during the\nblack screen between the copyright text and the GameFreak logo.\nBlackout Holding Window\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1. Start EonTimer and Boot the game as normal, without any held\nbuttons.\n2. Start holding your Blackout button(s) during the window (see\nabove image)\n3. Release your Blackout input when you see the leaves or flames at the\nTitle Screen (see below image)\n4. Press and hold your Button: input at the 6th beep on the Title\nScreen, until File Load screen appears.\n5. Release your Button: input, load your game and redeem your\nGift Pokemon on the final beep.\nHeld Button Release Window\n \n\nConfirming Pre-Calibration\nNow we'll use the Stats and Nature to confirm the Seed Hit\nusing Calibration.\nClick the Open in Calibration button to the right of your desired\nseed in the Initial Seed search results.\n\nThis will open the Calibration tab, pre-populated with the\nsettings needed for your chosen seed.\nYou'll only need to update the Advance Range, which should be set\nfrom 600 to 1000.\n\nThen enter the Level, Nature, and Stats of the Gift Pokemon and hit\nSubmit.\nIf you get no results, double check your in-game settings, EonTimer\nsettings, and G3 Calibration Settings all match The Ten Lines for\nyour seed, then try again. It could have just been a mistake with the\nbutton input, or an input error in one of the tools.\nIf you get a result, that means you successfully hit a seed with your\nheld= input.\nEnter ms and Advance values into EonTimer and click update.\n\n\nAfter this Calibration Update, make one more run to confirm you're\nhitting Target Seed.\nIt's also reasonable to consider it \"close enough\" once within\n16-33ms of your Target Seed, as long as you're getting\nconsistent results each time.\nThe First Attempt\nNow that we've successfully hit our seed, EonTimer's Seed(ms) has\nbeen calibrated, and we can start making attempts on our actual target\nAerodactyl.\nFirst, we'll need to update the Advance Range in Calibration,\nwhich can easily be done by going back to the Initial Seed tab and clicking the Calibration button once again.\nIt should automatically update Minimum Advances to 1000 early, and Maximum Advances 1000 late.\n\n\nIn our example, the Aerodactyl appears on Advance 14071, so our\nAdvance Range is 13071 to 14071.\nThis is quite a large range, but different types of encounters/gifts\nwill have different offsets than the Game Corner Prize, so we want\nto leave room for that variance.\nMake sure you're also doing the correct Final A Press as noted\nbelow.\n\n  List: Final A Press for all possible targets\n  It is not always clear what button to press and when to press it to encounter the Pokémon on your final timer beep. If a Pokémon just says \"Press X in front of it\", it means there is no dialogue box &amp; the encounter will start right away. Otherwise, the final text box is described.\n\nGift Pokemon\n\n\nBulbasaur: This POKéMON is really quite energetic!\n\n\nCharmander: This POKéMON is really quite energetic!\n\n\nSquirtle: This POKéMON is really quite energetic!\n\n\nMagikarp: So, you'll buy it, am I right? YES/NO\n\n\nOmanyte: Your fossil is back to life! It was OMANYTE like I think!\n\n\nKabuto: Your fossil is back to life! It was KABUTO like I think!\n\n\nAerodactyl: Your fossil is back to life! It was AERODACTYL like I\nthink!\n\n\nEevee: Press A in front of it\n\n\nAbra: (Game Corner) So, you want the ABRA? YES/NO\n\n\nClefairy: (Game Corner) So, you want the CLEFAIRY? YES/NO\n\n\nDratini: (Game Corner) So, you want the DRATINI? YES/NO\n\n\nPorygon: (Game Corner) So, you want the PORYGON? YES/NO\n\n\nPinsir: (Game Corner) So, you want the PINSIR? YES/NO\n\n\nScyther: (Game Corner) So, you want the SCYTHER? YES/NO\n\n\nHitmonlee: You want the hard-kicking HITMONLEE? YES/NO\n\n\nHitmonchan: You want the piston-punching HITMONCHAN? YES/NO\n\n\nLapras: I want you to have this POKéMON for saving us.\n\n\nTogepi: (Egg) Please, I'd like you to have this.\n\n\nStationary Pokemon\n\n\nSnorlax: It attacked in a grumpy rage!\n\n\nElectrode: (Power Plant) Press A in front of it\n\n\nHypno: (Berry Forest) Waaaaaaah! I want my daddy!\n\n\nMewtwo: Mew!\n\n\nLugia: Press A in front of it\n\n\nHo-oh: Press UP while facing up. Stand on the floor tile 1-step\nbefore Ho-oh descends.\n\n\nDeoxys: Press A in front of the Red Triangle\n\n\nLegendary Birds: The birds are a bit unusual, as they have a\ndialogue box AFTER you press A. So you Press A, the bird is generated,\nthen dialogue shows up.\n\n\nArticuno: Press A in front of it\n\n\nZapdos: Press A in front of it\n\n\nMoltres: Press A in front of it\n\n\n\nIf your target is Level 30 or above, then you can safely make this\nAdvance Range even larger.\nLugia, Ho-oh, and Deoxys specifically have rather long cutscenes\nin between the Final Press and the actual encounter being generated.\nSo expect your first attempt to be off by hundreds of Advances.\nUse Rare Candies to your advantage on Low Level targets for this\nfirst attempt, if you get multiple results. Once you've confirmed you're\nhitting close to your Target Advance you can shrink the Advance\nRange in Calibration down to limit duplicate results or false\npositives.\nMake sure to update the Advances in EonTimer to the new Target\nAdvance as well, and manually set the Calibration for Advances\nto 0.00. We want to preserve the Calibration for Seed(ms) but\nstart fresh on the Advances.\n\n\nUsing this EonTimer, make your first attempt, making sure to follow\nthe correct Held inputs as covered earlier. After my first attempt\non Aerodactyl, I hit my Target Seed and was exactly 100\nAdvances early.\n\n\nPersonally, I only adjust Advances when I actually hit my Target Seed. This prevents drifting too far away from the Target Advance due to human-introduced error.\nEvery frame of error on Seed translates to one fewer/extra frame passing between the Title Screen and the Target. \nFrom this point, there's no difference between Competitive Static RNG and \nBeginner Static RNG in terms of process.\nAs per usual, enter the Seed(ms) and Advance into the Hit\ninputs in EonTimer and click update to lock-in your Calibration.\nThen, make another attempt.\nOnce you start hitting within 16-50ms of the Target Seed, and\n1-3 Advances of the Target Advance, you should only adjust if\nyou start to consistently hit early or late.\nOptimal Calibration is sometimes early, sometimes late on both\nSeed and Advance. It can also be useful to adjust only\nSeed(ms) if you start missing your Target Seed by a consistent\namount.\nIt's normal for inputs to drift over time as a result of human error and\nfatigue.\nBe patient and don't give up! From this point on, it's just a matter\nof trial-and-error and input accuracy.\nOnce you understand how to find the 32-bit seeds of Competitive Pokemon\nusing PokeFinder, and using The Ten Lines to lookup the Timings,\nSettings, and Inputs needed to hit specific seeds-- you're fully\nequipped to RNG manipulate perfect competitive Pokemon like this!\n\nNext Steps...\nCompetitive Wild RNG and more Advanced Guides Coming Soon!\n","description":"Learn the full FR/LG Toolchain & Boot sequences to get a Perfect, Competitive Pokemon!","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/advanced/perfect-static-manip/","title":"FR/LG Perfect IV Static Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/":{"body":"","description":"Quick start and guides for installing the AdiDoks theme on your preferred operating system.","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/","title":"Beginner"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/frlgstarter/":{"body":"Overview\nThe first step of learning to manipulate the RNG of Pokemon FireRed &amp;\nLeafGreen begins with the Starter.\nOnce successful, you'll have both a Shiny Starter Pokemon and know your\nSecret ID for manipulating future Shiny Pokemon.\n\nIt should be noted that you cannot control your TID or SID with this\nmethod, but instead are using your TID and a Shiny Starter to deduce\nyour Secret ID.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green (any language)\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite, Nintendo 3DS w/ open_agb_firm\n\n\nWindows / Mac OS / Ubuntu PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\nHave a save file with text speed set to FAST\n\nTools Used\n\n\nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc6\n\n\nGen 3 IDs Tool\n\n\nTen Lines Calibration\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nim a blisy ._.\n\nThe Guide\nSettings\nIt's important that TEXT SPEED is set to FAST, before actually creating\nthe save file for the RNG. The game will remember these settings, even\nwhen creating a New Game over an existing save file. So if you don't\nalready have a save file, create a dummy save and then set TEXT SPEED to\nFAST before proceeding.\n\nNew Game Timer\nThe first step to getting a shiny starter is to start a New Game, and\nget to the Name Entry screen, and enter your desired name. There is no\ntime pressure here, the RNG starts moving after hitting the OK button.\n\nAfter entering your desired name, open EonTimer, click the Custom tab (C) and then hit the + button once.\nSet Unit to \"Advances\" and Target to 901.\n\n\n\nThen click the gear icon in the bottom left, and make sure your console setting is correct.\n\n\nRegular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf playing on 3DS using open_agb_firm, you would also select NDS - Slot 2.\n\nOnce everything is set up correctly, advance to the next screen and\nstart EonTimer at the same time.\nThe goal is to press A with the 6th beep on this text box:\n\n\"Your very own POKEMON legend is about to unfold!\"\n\nThis will cause the game to advance to the players bedroom, at which\npoint, you can open your Trainer Card and check your Trainer ID.\n\nFinding Potential SIDs\nThe Trainer ID was set immediately upon leaving the Naming Screen.\n\nFire Red &amp; Leaf Green used this Trainer ID to seed the RNG, which then\ndetermines your Secret ID.\nUpon pressing A at the final text box of the intro cutscene, the Secret\nID is locked in 249 RNG advances later.\n\n\n  Note: Frames Vs Advances\n  Frames and Advances are often used interchangeably across RNG documentation, guides, and tools.\n\nFrames is a commonly used term to describe game-state intervals in Speedrunning and Fighting Games. Updating video game logic every visual frame is a common practice, and this is generally how it works Generation 3, but not always\n\nHowever, in some games this isn’t always the case. The frames you visually see might be completely separate from the game’s logic. RNG Advances accurately describes what’s happening, no matter the situation.\n\nBy setting EonTimer's Target to 901, this gives us enough time to\nadvance past the text boxes, and then hit the final A-Press 249 advances\nbefore our target Secret ID. Assuming we're frame perfect, the game will\nask the RNG for a number 1150 advances after the TID was set.\nNOTE: Non-English games will have slightly different advance\nvalues than 249, due to the number of characters needed for the next\nunskippable text box. This will also vary based on the TEXT SPEED\nsetting. For consistent results, choose FAST.\n\nSID Advance Values on FAST text speed.\nLanguageAdvancesSecret ID from 901 Timer\nEnglish-2491150\nJapanese-1941095\nItalian-2361137\nFrench-2051106\nGerman-2081109\nSpanish-2021103\n\nWe can view all of these potential SIDs using Lincoln's Gen 3 IDs tool, which is a web tool that can be found here.\nFirst, enter the Trainer ID you received into to text box below, and click Convert to take the decimal value from the Trainer Card and convert it to a Hexadecimal. \n\n\n\n\n    Convert\n\n        \n        \n    \n\t\t\n\nEnter that value into the Initial Seed box in Gen 3 IDs.\nFor Initial Advances reference the Secret ID from 901 Timer column from the table above, and enter that value minus 10.\n\n(ex. English would enter 1140, and Japanese would enter 1085).\nSet Max Advances to 20. Click Generate to populate\nthe results table.\nOur example seed was 35DD and we find the Target SID by scrolling to Advance #1150 and checking the SID column which\nin our example would be 53782.\n\nThe TID column will not match your game in this case, because this tool can also be used for Ruby &amp; Sapphire where the Trainer ID and Secret ID are set together.\n\nThere's no guarantee that your first attempt was frame perfect, but with\nthis list we can use process of elimination to figure out which Secret\nID is correct.\nBy attempting to RNG manipulate a Shiny Starter Pokemon, we can know for\ncertain which Secret ID on this list is correct.\nOur next step is to progress the game up until we can SAVE right in\nfront of the Starter PokeBall.\nMake sure to grab the POTION from the PC in your Bedroom!\n\nFrom here we can safely reset and quickly claim our Starter Pokemon\nusing EonTimer, but since Shiny Pokemon vary based on Trainer ID and\nSecret ID, the target seed and advances will be different for everyone.\n\nWe can use Lincoln's web-based Gen 3 RNG Tools to search for nearby\npotential Shiny targets, and get the numbers necessary to set up\nEonTimer.\nCalculating Starter Timer\nTo get started, open Lincoln's Ten Lines Calibration here.\nSelect your Game, and then leave the Sound, L, A, and Held\nButton settings on the default values of Mono, L=A, A, and None.\nMake sure to select your System, as the boot-up times and\nframe-rates are slightly different based on the console, and the tool\naccounts for those.\n\nOpen the settings in-game, and change Sound and Button Mode to\nmatch these settings in the tool.\nMake sure to SAVE after confirming these settings!\n\nLeave the default Target Seed (hex) and Seed +\\-.\nSet Minimum Advances to 1000 and Maximum Advances to 5000. This means your maximum wait time\nwill be ~2 minutes.\nLeave Offset at the default value of 0.\nLeave the Encounter Method as Static 1. Then select Starter for Category and the Pokemon you want to receive.\nEnter the Trainer ID and Secret ID you've just gotten from\nthe Gen 3 IDs tool.\nSelect Star/Square for the Shininess setting. This will filter to all\npossible Shiny targets.\nSquare Shiny is only relevant if sending to Sword/Shield, but the\noption is there.\nLeave Nature setting on Any for now. If you want a specific Nature, you can go for that after you know your Secret ID is correct.\n\nOnce these settings are correct, click Submit to search for all the\npotential Shiny Pokemon you could attempt to RNG.\nWARNING: Your Browser might freeze momentarily while calculating, just\nwait. If anything pops up click \"Wait\" or \"Continue\".\n\nWhen the search is complete, there should be a table of potential\nShiny Seeds and Advances.\nYou can select any of these, but prioritize the lowest Advance\nnumber to make attempts faster!\nIf you get zero Shiny results, you can alter the settings above to a\ndifferent SOUND or BUTTON MODE.\nJust remember to update those settings in-game as well.\n\nThe highlighted option was the best for my example run, so now we can\nset up EonTimer to aim for that Shiny specifically. Open\nEonTimer and click the + button to add a second timer. Set the first\ntimer Unit to ms and the second timer Unit to Advances.\n\nEnter the Seed ms value next to your chosen seed, and the\nAdvances number from the search results.\nEonTimer is now set up to make your first attempt at the potential\nShiny.\nNow you'll need to update the settings\nboxes in the Calibration tool before continuing.\nReplace the Target Seed with the selected Seed from the\nsearch. In our example this is 10C5.\nMake the Minimum for Advance Range 200 less than your target, and\nthe Maximum 200 advances more.\nSet the Shiny Filter back to Any.\nSet the Nature Filter to Hardy, to enable IV Calculation\noptions. We'll use these to identify which Starter we hit if not Shiny.\n\nThe Calibration tab is now fully set up for this Shiny target.\nWe're now ready for...\nThe First Attempt\nThe startup sequence is slightly different depending on the console\nbeing used.\nReference the following Boot method for your system of choice:\n\n  Boot Methods\n  NDS: Press A on \"Start GBA Game\" from the DS Home Screen\n\nOFFICIAL GAMEBOY PLAYER: Press the \"Change Game Pak\" button, and\nconfirm to Hard Reset\n\n3DS OPEN_AGB_FIRM: Press A to boot the Fire Red/Leaf Green ROM file\n\nGAMEBOY INTERFACE (GBI): Hold and Release the RESET button, or use\nHard Reset Button Combo\n\n(Note: GBI boot times and frame-rate are identical to real GBA, so use\nGBA in the system selector)\n\nGBA: Flick the Power Switch\n\nGBA users might find this difficult. In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n1. Boot the game and click Start on EonTimer at the same time.\n2. Wait for the ENTIRE Introduction to play, DO NOT PRESS ANY\nBUTTONS or SKIP. Your first timer should be long enough to make it to the Title Screen.\n3. When the timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st of 6\nbeeps.\n4. ON THE 6TH BEEP, PRESS and HOLD the A Button.\n5. Once the File Load screen appears, you can release all buttons\nand press A to load your save.\n6. Mash B to skip past any \"Previously on...\" screens.\n7. Mash A on the starter PokeBall, and get to the \"This POKéMON is\nreally quite energetic!\" text box.\n8. When the second timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st\nof 6 beeps.\n9. ON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to lock-in your starter.\n\n  Note: How do seeds work?\n  Seeds in FireRed and LeafGreen are determined by an ultra-fast timer in\nthe GBA's CPU called Timer1.\n\nTraditional soft resetting using A + B + START + SELECT does not work,\nbecause the starting value of Timer1 is only consistent from a hard boot\nof the game-- which is identified by the presence of the GAMEBOY BIOS\nscreen.\n\nEvery input the user makes during the boot up sequence, as well as\nthe Sound and Button Mode settings in the save file, have an effect on\nTimer1 and therefore, the initial seeding process.\n\nFor this reason, it's important to not press any buttons or skip the\nintro cutscene, until the final button press at the Title Screen. The\nseed is set while the game transitions from the Title Screen to the File\nLoad screen.\n\nReducing this process to only providing a single input after a specific\namount of time, bypasses all the potential interference with Timer1 and\nallows the player to consistently hit the same seeds.\n\nThis is possible because even though Timer1 is MUCH faster than 60fps,\nthe game only checks for button inputs every frame. The seeds were\ntested and recorded using an automated bot that performs the button\ninput frame perfectly, after a set number of milliseconds.\n\nClicking the \"Show Seeds\" button will display a list of all the Seeds\nthe program is currently using for its search. The \"Target Seed\" should\nappear in the middle of the list, and the seeds around it are in\nsequential order based on the millisecond value the bot was programmed\nto use.\n\nThe final ms value shown for each seed in the search results, is\nautomatically adjusted for the selected system based on hard coded\nboot-time offsets, and the frame-rate of the chosen system.\n\nInitial Calibration\nOpen your Pokemon's summary and look at the Nature and Stats.\n\n\nOpen the Calibration tab from Lincoln's web tools, select the Nature and Gender, then enter Stats into the IV\nCalculator in the following order: LEVEL HP ATK DEF SPA SPD SPE\n\n\nThis should automatically populate the Stat ranges with the best guess\npossible given the Level 5 data.\nClicking Submit will search for all the potential starters this\ncould be, and you'll likely get many results:\n\nIn order to narrow down this range we need to reach Level 6.\nIdeally you win the Rival Battle (grab the POTION from the PC in your\nBedroom).\nIf you lose you can use Wild Pokemon. MAKE SURE NOT TO SAVE.\n\n\nPress Enter to add a new row to the IV Calculator and input the Level 6 stats.\nClick Submit again, and hopefully the range is reduced down to only\n1 result, which confirms the Pokemon hit.\n\n\nIf you still have more than 1 result, you can go to Level 7 or 8.\nYou must be careful of gaining Effort Values (EVs) when leveling up.\nEVs will increase stats beyond their untrained values and interfere with\nthe IV calculations\nEach battle will gain +1 EV in a specific stat. Don't gain more than 3\nEVs for a single stat.\nSpeciesEV Yield\nBulbasaur+1 Special Attack\nSquirtle+1 Special Defense\nCharmander+1 Speed\nPidgey+1 Speed\nRattata+1 Speed\nMankey+1 Attack\nSpearow+1 Speed\n\nIf this still yields no results, there was an error in the attempt and\nyou must check all your settings and try again. Double check in-game\nsettings match the settings in the g3 calibration tool, and that the\ntimers match your target seed/advance.\nThis single result gives us the values needed to adjust EonTimer\nappropriately to make sure our next attempt is closer to our target.\n\nEnter the Seed ms and the Advance number into the Hit fields in\nEonTimer, and then click Update.\n\n\nThe Calibration numbers should update, and you can turn off your\ngame and make another attempt using the new EonTimer calibration.\nAttempts &amp; Adjustment\nRepeat the same steps of:\n\n\nEntering the Nature and Level 5 Stats\n\n\nCompleting the Rival Battle and reaching Level 6\n\n\nLevelling up as needed to reach a single result\n\n\nInputting the Seed ms, and Advance into EonTimer and clicking Update\n\n\n\n\nOnce your calibration is within the range of +/- 50ms for the Seed, and\n+/- 3 for Advances you can confidently narrow the search range in G3\nCalibration to speed up attempts.\nLower Seed +/- to 10 and Advance Range to 10 advances below and\nabove your target.\n\nWith this smaller search range, you should be able to get a single\nresult after only inputting the Level 5 Stats and Nature. If you still\nget 2 results, proceed to Level 6 using the Rival Battle to be sure.\nAt this point, you must repeat attempts until you successfully hit\nyour Target Seed and Advance.\nThis requires two frame perfect inputs, so it can be difficult.\nOnly Update the calibration of EonTimer, if you notice you are\nconsistently hitting early or late over multiple attempts. The optimal\nCalibration will have you landing sometimes early, sometimes late.\nNow it's a matter of overcoming human error to succeed.\nEventually, you will either hit your Shiny or hit the correct\nSeed/Advances and find it is NOT Shiny.\n\n\nThis means your Potential Secret ID for this attempt was not\ncorrect.\nNext Secret ID\nReturn to your list of Potential Secret IDs and you can eliminate\nthe Secret ID at Advance 1150.\n\n\nReturn to the Calculating Starter Timer section, but change\nthe Secret ID in G3 Calibration to match either Advance 1149 or\nAdvance 1151.\nRepeat the cycle of:\n\n\n\nAssume a new Secret ID\n\n\nSearch for Nearest Shiny Starter\n\n\nMake Attempt and Calculate Stats\n\n\nAdjust EonTimer\n\n\nRepeat Attempts Until Stats \\ Nature Match\n\n\nIf not Shiny, return to Step 1...\n\n\nUntil...\n\n\nThe Shiny confirms the example Trainer ID/Secret ID as 13789/42915.\n1148 Advances on the Secret ID list.\n\nYou could now use this Secret ID to search for a Shiny with a better\nNature and/or IVs.\nIf you'd like to Nickname your Shiny now, reset over it and repeat with\nthe same timer/settings.\nDON'T LOSE this Trainer ID and Secret ID Combination for your Save!\nFailure Conditions\nIt's absolutely possible to get your Shiny Starter after checking only 1\nor 2 SIDs. However, it entirely depends on how accurately the timer was\nhit during the intro cutscene, and whether or not errors were made.\n\nIt's fairly common for first timers to check 5 or more SIDs without\nseeing a Shiny. It can be frustrating, but DON'T GIVE UP.\n\nHowever, as a general rule, I don't recommend checking beyond the\nrange of 1145 to 1155. If the Intro portion is done correctly, it's very\nunlikely to be more than 5 advances off.\n\nIn the event you've verified your Secret ID is definitely not between\n1145 to 1155, it's a good idea to start a New Game and try hitting\nAdvance 1150 on a new Trainer ID.\n\nIt's a bit of a gamble either way. You could be one extra SID check away\nfrom your Shiny, or you might have made a mistake in the Intro Sequence\nand wind up checking 20 SIDs with no Shiny.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, once you see a Shiny Starter and your Secret\nID is confirmed, RNG manipulating the rest of the game is now available\nto you.\nNext Steps...\nWith the Starter &amp; TID/SID Manip out of the way, you're ready to move on to the next steps!\nEither Static or Wild Manips will do, although, Wild is slightly more challenging.

However, if using particularly\nstrict Nature or IV filters and receiving no results, you can change \"A\nButton\" and \"Held Button\" to check even more seeds.\n\n\"A Button\" refers to the final A press on the Title Screen. This can be\nchanged to either START or L (L=A).\n\nSTART would mean pressing and holding START on the Title Screen\ninstead of the A Button.\n\nL (L=A) only works when BUTTON MODE is L=A, and means pressing and\nholding L on the Title Screen.\n\n\"Held Button\" refers to optional buttons that can be held during the\nboot-up sequence and intro cutscene.\n\nFor beginners, STARTUP SELECT is the only option that requires no\nspecial timing.\n\nSTART UP A and the BLACKOUT Held Buttons will be covered in an\nADVANCED guide.\n\nSTARTUP SELECT means holding SELECT before booting the game, and\nholding it until the File Load screen appears.

In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n1.

ON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to receive the gift, or encounter the\nPokemon.\n\n  Note: How do seeds work?\n  Seeds in FireRed and LeafGreen are determined by an ultra-fast timer in\nthe GBA's CPU called Timer1.\n\nTraditional soft resetting using A + B + START + SELECT does not work,\nbecause the starting value of Timer1 is only consistent from a hard boot\nof the game-- which is identified by the presence of the GAMEBOY BIOS\nscreen.\n\nEvery input the user makes during the boot up sequence, as well as\nthe Sound and Button Mode settings in the save file, have an effect on\nTimer1 and therefore, the initial seeding process.\n\nFor this reason, it's important to not press any buttons or skip the\nintro cutscene, until the final button press at the Title Screen. The\nseed is set while the game transitions from the Title Screen to the File\nLoad screen.\n\nReducing this process to only providing a single input after a specific\namount of time, bypasses all the potential interference with Timer1 and\nallows the player to consistently hit the same seeds.\n\nThis is possible because even though Timer1 is MUCH faster than 60fps,\nthe game only checks for button inputs every frame. The seeds were\ntested and recorded using an automated bot that performs the button\ninput frame perfectly, after a set number of milliseconds.\n\nClicking the \"Show Seeds\" button will display a list of all the Seeds\nthe program is currently using for its search. The \"Target Seed\" should\nappear in the middle of the list, and the seeds around it are in\nsequential order based on the millisecond value the bot was programmed\nto use.\n\nThe final ms value shown for each seed in the search results, is\nautomatically adjusted for the selected system based on hard coded\nboot-time offsets, and the frame-rate of the chosen system.\n\nInitial Calibration\nIf target Pokemon requires capture, it's generally a good idea to use a\nMaster Ball for calibration purposes. This makes each attempt faster, by\ninstantly acquiring the Pokemon to calculate stats. You will be\nresetting, so you'll always have the Master Ball for later. On final\ncapture, use your PokeBall of choice.\nAfter receiving/catching, open the Pokemon's summary and look at the\nNature and Stats.\n\nOpen the Calibration tool, select your target Species, set *Shininess to Any, select\nthe Nature, select the Gender, and then enter Stats into the IV Calculator in the following\norder: LEVEL HP ATK DEF SPA SPD SPE\n\nThis should automatically populate the Stat ranges with the best guess\npossible given the inputted data.\nClicking Submit will search for all the potential Pokemon this could\nbe, and if the Pokemon is a low level (like Magikarp) you'll likely get\nmany results.\nIf you get no results, then increase Advance Range to 1000 advances\nabove and below target, and increase Seed +/- to 50. If this still\nyields no results, there was an error in the attempt and you must check\nall your settings and try again. Double check in-game settings match the\nsettings in the calibration tool, and that the timers match your\ntarget seed/advance.\n\nOur goal is to get a single result, so to narrow down this range we\nmight need to level up the Pokemon. Rare Candy is the best option,\nbecause leveling with Rare Candies provides no Effort Values (EVs).\nFor Magikarp, there is an easily available Rare Candy in the Southeast\ncorner of Mt. Moon's 1st Floor you can grab before the RNG. For later\ntargets, save all Rare Candies you find, as you likely only need 1-2 in\norder to narrow down results.\n\n\nPress Enter to add a new row to the IV Calculator and input the Level 6 stats. Click Submit again, and hopefully the range is reduced down to only 1 result, which confirms the Pokemon hit.\n\nOnce the Search has been reduced to a single result and you can adjust\nEonTimer to calibrate for the next attempt, by entering the values\nfrom the table and clicking Update.\n\nThe values in Calibration should update accordingly, and you can now\nturn off your game and begin a second attempt.\nAttempts &amp; Adjustment\nRepeat the same steps of:\n\n\nPerforming the startup sequence with EonTimer\n\n\nRedeeming/Capturing the Pokemon\n\n\nEntering Stats and Leveling Up as needed to reach a single search\nresult\n\n\nInputting the Seed ms, and Advance into EonTimer and clicking Update\n\n\n\nOnce your calibration is within the range of +/- 50ms for the Seed,\nand +/- 3 for Advances you can confidently narrow the search range\nin Calibration to speed up attempts.\nLower Seed +/- to 10 and Advance Range to 10 advances below and\nabove your target.\n\nWith this smaller search range, you should be able to get a single\nresult after only inputting the stats of the received Pokemon. On the\noff chance you still get two or more results, use a Rare Candy again.\nAt this point, you must repeat attempts until you successfully hit\nyour Target Seed and Advance.\nThis requires two frame perfect inputs, so it can be difficult.\nOnly Update the calibration of EonTimer, if you notice you are\nconsistently hitting early or late over multiple attempts. The optimal\nCalibration will have you landing sometimes early, sometimes late.\nNow it's a matter of overcoming human error to succeed.\nEventually, you will hit your Shiny!\n\nNext Steps...\nSweet Scent RNG Manips will be right up your alley after you mastered Static! They are slightly more challenging because deducing which Pokemon you hit is more difficult. But it still remains a \"Press A at right moment\" check, with no other nonsense, so you'll be able to get the hang of it!\n","description":"How to get a Gift, Legendary, or Static Pokemon!","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/frlgstatic/","title":"FR/LG Static Encounter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/frlgwild/":{"body":"Overview\nThis guide will cover beginner-level Wild RNG manipulation in FireRed\nand LeafGreen.

If anything pops up click \"Wait\" or \"Continue\".\n\nWhen the search is complete, there should be a table of potential\nShiny Seeds and Advances.\nThe Slot column in the results will show potential Shiny targets for all available Pokemon in the selected location.\nYou can check the Filter box to only show the target species.\nOur target will be Mankey on Route 4.\n\n\nThere might not be any Shiny results that match target Pokemon\nyou're searching for, especially for the rare encounters on the route.\nEncounter SlotRarityEncounter SlotRarity\nSlot 020%Slot 65%\nSlot 120%Slot 75%\nSlot 210%Slot 84%\nSlot 310%Slot 94%\nSlot 410%Slot 101%\nSlot 510%Slot 111%\n\nIn this case, increase maximum wait time on the Title Screen) OR alter the\nsettings above to a different SOUND or BUTTON MODE, and Submit\nthe search again**. Remember to update those settings in-game as well!**\n\n  NOTE: Changing 'A Button' or 'Held Button' in G3 Calibration\n  For general purposes, changing only SOUND or BUTTON MODE should provide\na sufficient variety of Shiny targets. However, if using particularly\nstrict Nature or IV filters and receiving no results, you can change \"A\nButton\" and \"Held Button\" to check even more seeds.\n\n\"A Button\" refers to the final A press on the Title Screen. This can be\nchanged to either START or L (L=A).\n\nSTART would mean pressing and holding START on the Title Screen\ninstead of the A Button.\n\nL (L=A) only works when BUTTON MODE is L=A, and means pressing and\nholding L on the Title Screen.\n\n\"Held Button\" refers to optional buttons that can be held during the\nboot-up sequence and intro cutscene.\n\nFor beginners, STARTUP SELECT is the only option that requires no\nspecial timing.\n\nSTART UP A and the BLACKOUT Held Buttons will be covered in an\nADVANCED guide.\n\nSTARTUP SELECT means holding SELECT before booting the game, and\nholding it until the File Load screen appears. You must continue holding\nit, even while doing your final button press &amp; hold on the Title\nScreen.\n\nOnce you've chosen your desired target Shiny, change the Target Seed\n(hex) to match the Seed, and update the Advance Range to 500\nadvances above and below your target.\n\nIn our example, Mankey is Encounter Slot 8 or 10 and a Quiet Shiny was\nfound on seed E476 and Advance 2064. Which means the Advance Range\nbecomes 1564 to 2564.\nNow we update EonTimer for this target as well.\nTimer Setup\nOpen EonTimer 3.0.0-RC6, and switch over to the Custom Tab (C).\nClick the (+) button at the bottom, and add two timer sections.\nMake the Unit of the first timer ms, and the second timer\nAdvances.\nEnter the ms value from the Seed into the first Target box.\nEnter the Advances value of the Shiny into the second Target box.\n\n\nThen click the gear icon in the bottom left, and make sure your\nconsole setting is correct.\n\n\nGBA and NDS-GBA have slightly different frame rates.\nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS-GBA: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative\nto the actual game.\nIf playing on 3DS using open_agb_firm, you would also select NDS - Slot\n2.\nThe tools are now set up for...\nThe First Attempt\nIn-game get your character to the correct position so you can\nimmediately use Sweet Scent to start the Wild encounter.\nOpen your in-game settings and double check that they match the SOUND\nand BUTTON MODE settings for the target Seed at the top of G3\nCalibration.\nSave your game, and then Power Off the system.\nThe startup sequence is slightly different depending on the console\nbeing used.\nReference the following Boot method for your system of choice.\n\n  Boot Methods\n  NDS: Press A on \"Start GBA Game\" from the DS Home Screen\n\nOFFICIAL GAMEBOY PLAYER: Press the \"Change Game Pak\" button, and\nconfirm to Hard Reset\n\n3DS OPEN_AGB_FIRM: Press A to boot the Fire Red/Leaf Green ROM file\n\nGAMEBOY INTERFACE (GBI): Hold and Release the RESET button, or use\nHard Reset Button Combo\n\n(Note: GBI boot times and frame-rate are identical to real GBA, so use\nGBA in the system selector)\n\nGBA: Flick the Power Switch\n\nGBA users might find this difficult. In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n1. Boot the game and click Start on EonTimer at the same time.\n2. Wait for the ENTIRE Introduction to play, DO NOT PRESS ANY\nBUTTONS or SKIP. Your first timer should be long enough to make it to the Title Screen.\n3. When the timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st of 6\nbeeps.\n4. ON THE 6TH BEEP, PRESS and HOLD the A Button.\n5. Once the File Load screen appears, you can release all buttons\nand press A to load your save.\n6. Mash B to skip past any \"Previously on...\" screens.\n7a. Press START to open the menu, go into POKEMON, and then hover over\nSWEET SCENT\n8. When the second timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st\nof 6 beeps.\n9. ON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to use SWEET SCENT.\n\n  Note: How do seeds work?\n  Seeds in FireRed and LeafGreen are determined by an ultra-fast timer in\nthe GBA's CPU called Timer1.\n\nTraditional soft resetting using A + B + START + SELECT does not work,\nbecause the starting value of Timer1 is only consistent from a hard boot\nof the game-- which is identified by the presence of the GAMEBOY BIOS\nscreen.\n\nEvery input the user makes during the boot up sequence, as well as\nthe Sound and Button Mode settings in the save file, have an effect on\nTimer1 and therefore, the initial seeding process.\n\nFor this reason, it's important to not press any buttons or skip the\nintro cutscene, until the final button press at the Title Screen. The\nseed is set while the game transitions from the Title Screen to the File\nLoad screen.\n\nReducing this process to only providing a single input after a specific\namount of time, bypasses all the potential interference with Timer1 and\nallows the player to consistently hit the same seeds.\n\nThis is possible because even though Timer1 is MUCH faster than 60fps,\nthe game only checks for button inputs every frame. The seeds were\ntested and recorded using an automated bot that performs the button\ninput frame perfectly, after a set number of milliseconds.\n\nClicking the \"Show Seeds\" button will display a list of all the Seeds\nthe program is currently using for its search. The \"Target Seed\" should\nappear in the middle of the list, and the seeds around it are in\nsequential order based on the millisecond value the bot was programmed\nto use.\n\nThe final ms value shown for each seed in the search results, is\nautomatically adjusted for the selected system based on hard coded\nboot-time offsets, and the frame-rate of the chosen system.\n\nInitial Calibration\nIf possible, it's generally a good idea to use a Master Ball for\ncalibration purposes. This makes each attempt faster, by instantly\nacquiring the Pokemon to calculate stats. You will be resetting, so\nyou'll always have the Master Ball for later. On final capture, use your\nPokeBall of choice.\nAfter catching, open the Pokemon's summary and look at the Nature\nand Stats.\n\n\nOpen the Calibration tool, set Shiny back to Any,\nselect your caught Species, select the Nature and then enter Stats into\nthe IV Calculator in the following order: LEVEL HP ATK DEF SPA SPD\nSPE\n\n\nThis should automatically populate the Stat ranges with the best guess\npossible given the inputted data.\nClicking Submit will search for all the potential Pokemon this could\nbe, and if the Pokemon is a low level you'll likely get many results.\n\n\nIf there are too many results, we have to narrow down which Pokemon we\nactually hit. In this case, using Rare Candy to level up and provide\nmore stats for the calculator to use can reduce the results.\n\n\nIn our case, this actually caused the search to yield no results.\nHowever, this is expected sometimes, because Wild Pokemon in FireRed and\nLeafGreen can be generated using different Encounter Methods.\n\n  Note: What are Methods?\n  Methods result in different sets of IVs for a Pokemon, from the same RNG\nAdvance. However, they have the same PID, which means they will still be\nShiny and have the same Nature.\n\nWhich Method you get on a Wild Pokemon is out of the player's control\nin FireRed and LeafGreen. Method 1 is the most common, but it's\npossible to hit Method 2 or Method 4 instead-- so it's\nimportant to check all three for Wild RNG manipulation.\n\nThis setting can be changed in the Encounter Method dropdown in the\ntool. Every time we search for which Pokemon we hit, it's important to\ncheck All Wild Methods.\n\n\nThis allows us to find our Level 10 Rattata on Encounter Method Wild 4.\nIf you get NO results on ANY METHOD, then increase Advance Range to\n1000 advances above and below target, and increase Seed +/- to 50.\nIncrease levels with Rare Candy as necessary. If this still yields no\nresults, there was an error in the attempt and you must check all your\nsettings and try again. Double check in-game settings match the settings\nin the Calibration tool, and that the timers match your target\nseed/advance.\nNow that Rattata has been confirmed, we can enter the millisecond\nand Advance values from the result that matches our Encounter\nSlot into EonTimer and then click Update.\n\n\nThe values in Calibration should update accordingly, and you can now\nturn off your game and begin a second attempt.\nAttempts &amp; Adjustment\nRepeat the same steps of:\n\n\nPerforming the startup sequence with EonTimer\n\n\nCapturing the Pokemon\n\n\nEntering Stats, Checking Methods, and Leveling Up as needed to reach\na single search result\n\n\nInputting the Seed ms, and Advance into EonTimer and clicking Update\n\n\nMy next attempt was this Level 6 Sandshrew.\n\n\nThis was my second attempt, and I hit my target seed of E476 and was only 2\nadvances early.\nOnce your calibration is within the range of +/- 50ms for the Seed,\nand +/- 3 for Advances you can confidently narrow the search range\nin Calibration to speed up attempts.\nLower Seed +/- to 10 and Advance Range to 20 advances below and\nabove your target.\n\nWith this smaller search range, you should be able to get a single\nresult after only inputting the stats of the Pokemon. If you still get\ntwo or more results, use Rare Candy and Encounter Slots to narrow it\ndown again.\nAt this point, you must repeat attempts until you successfully hit\nyour Target Seed and Advance.\nThis requires two frame perfect inputs, so it can be difficult.\nOnly Update the calibration of EonTimer, if you notice you are\nconsistently hitting early or late over multiple attempts. The optimal\nCalibration will have you landing sometimes early, sometimes late.\nNow it's a matter of overcoming human error to succeed.\nEventually, you will hit your Shiny!\n\n\nOne of the nicest things about successfully doing a Wild RNG manipulation, is that other Routes will have the same Shiny Advances as your current calibration. This means, you can keep EonTimer setup exactly as it was for your first Wild RNG, but use Sweet Scent in different locations. You'll get the same Shiny but with whatever species lines up with your target Encounter Slot for the route!\nNext Steps...\nCongratulations! You've finished all the Beginner RNG Manips for Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green!\nAt this point, I reccomend continuing onto some more advanced Manips in the Intermediate or Advanced sections. \nIntermediate will contain a lot of familiar techniques showcased here, but with various different challenges. Things like Roamer, Fishing, and The Safari Zone are all more challenging than these manips, while still being \"Press A at Right Moment\". It's other things that complicate them.\nAdvanced will contain extremely challenging manips, for those who want to go the extra mile to gain Perfect IV Shiny Pokemon / Very Rare Pokemon. \n","description":"How to get a Wild Pokemon from the tall grass, surfing, or caves!","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/frlgwild/","title":"FR/LG Wild Encounter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/introduction/":{"body":"\nFireRed and LeafGreen have a reputation for being more difficult to RNG manipulate than Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald-- and for good reason. Those games all start from a fixed initial seed, which means their RNG is perfectly predictable every time you boot the game. \nIn Ruby and Sapphire, this is only the case if the internal battery that governs the Real-Time Clock has died, but Emerald is bugged to always start from the same initial seed.\nHowever, FireRed and LeafGreen do not have an internal battery or any Real-Time Clock functions. Instead, their initial RNG seed is determined based on an ultra-fast timer that starts running the instant you boot the game. This timer runs much faster than 60 frames-per-second, and every button input the user makes during the intro sequence has an effect on the initial seed.\nThis might make it sound like RNG manipulation in FireRed and LeafGreen is nearly impossible, but thankfully, years of research have come together to make this process 100% under the player’s control.\n\nThe secret is letting the entire intro sequence play, from the GAMEBOY boot screen to the Title Screen. This takes about 35 seconds, and afterwards the seed can be decided with a single press &amp; hold input.\nThe game only reads inputs once-per-frame, so this technique makes it possible for humans to hit the same seeds consistently-- as long as it’s on official GBA hardware. \nWhen combined with something like an arduino to automatically test and record those different timings, it became possible to build an entire database of seeds with consistent and repeatable timings! \nThat means instead of one fixed initial seed, you have access to thousands of different initial seeds! This improves the variety of Natures and IV spreads available for RNG manipulation, and even makes it possible to encounter perfect competitive Shiny Pokemon with only a few minutes of waiting...\n\n... but this power comes at a cost: TWO frame perfect inputs.\nIn order to successfully RNG manipulate FireRed and LeafGreen you must hit two inputs with 16.66 millisecond accuracy back-to-back. Once at the Title Screen to lock in your initial seed, and again when you make your last button press to encounter or redeem a Pokemon.\nFor this reason, FireRed and LeafGreen RNG are effectively twice as difficult as Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, but don’t let this discourage you. \nThis guide has been set-up with beginners in mind, and thanks to many hours of research being rolled into some fantastic new tools the process has never been more approachable.\nThe first lesson starts with getting a Shiny Starter and determining your Secret ID, which is required to RNG manipulate Shiny Pokemon throughout the rest of the game. \nCompleting that process will give you the skills to acquire Shiny Gift Pokemon, Wild Pokemon, Safari Zone Pokemon, Roaming Legendaries, and even Perfect Competitive Shiny Pokemon-- without hacking your save, using an emulator, or plugging in a cheating device.\nSo, without further ado... let’s move on to FireRed &amp; Leaf Green Starter RNG &amp; SID Deduction\n - Papa Jefé","description":"A brief passage about what makes FR/LG RNGs unique!","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/beginner/introduction/","title":"FR/LG RNG Manip Introduction"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/intermediate/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://retailrng.com/frlg/intermediate/","title":"Intermediate"},"https://retailrng.com/frlg/intermediate/fishing/":{"body":"Overview\nThis guide will cover Fishing RNG manipulation in FireRed and LeafGreen.\nThe focus will be on acquiring Shiny Pokemon, without concern for\ncompetitive Natures or IVs.\nThis is Intermediate-Level because Fishing has extra elements of\nrandomness introduced compared to standard Static or Sweet Scent\nencounters.\nThe first element of randomness is the fishing process itself. You\ncannot always get a fish on your first cast, and every additional cast\nadds extra RNG advances.\nThe second element of randomness is in the levels of the caught Pokemon.\nFishing encounters have very wide level ranges for each Encounter\nSlot so it can make identifying the caught Pokemon less\nstraightforward than Sweet Scent, where levels are fixed.\nFishing in FireRed and LeafGreen has quite a few exclusive species.\nBoth Games:\n\nGoldeen\\Seaking\nHorsea\\Seadra\nPoliwag\\Poliwhirl\nKrabby\\Kingler\n\nFireRed Only:\n\nShellder\\Cloyster \nQwilfish \n\nLeafGreen Only:\n\nStaryu\\Starmie\nRemoraid\\Octillery \n\nWe will be going for Shiny Grimer which is an often forgotten Rare\nspawn with the Super Rod at the pond in Celadon City.\nYou must know your Secret ID to find viable targets, which would be\ndone during the Shiny Starter RNG process. If you are on a completed\nsave and DO NOT know your Secret ID, there are methods to deduce\nit using a previously caught Shiny, using glitches to read it from a\nPokemon, or view it via extracting Save Data and using a tool like\nPkHex.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements:\n\n\nPokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green (any language)\n\n\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite, Nintendo 3DS w/\nopen_agb_firm\n\n\nWindows / Mac OS / Ubuntu PC\n\n\nIn-game Requirements:\n\n\nSave in front of the body of water used to Fish\n\n\nThe Fishing Rod required for your target, registered to the SELECT\nbutton\n\n\nPick up all Items on the ground in the area (they can cause extra\nRNG advances)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party\n\n\nPokeballs to capture it\n\n\nPokémon to aid in capture, such as a false swipe user or a spore\nuser.\n\n\n\n\nMaster Ball (optional, but recommended for quick capture/stat\ncalculation)\n\n\n\nAt least one Rare Candy (5+ is helpful, but not required)\n\nTools Used\n\n\nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc6\n\n\nTen Lines Calibration\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nFinding a Shiny Target\nTo get started, open Lincoln's Ten Lines Calibration here\nSelect your Game, and then leave the Sound, L, A, and Held\nButton settings on the default values of Mono, L=A, A, and None.\nMake sure to select your System, as the boot-up times and\nframe-rates are slightly different based on the console, and the tool\naccounts for those.\n\nOpen the settings in-game, and change Sound and Button Mode to\nmatch these settings in the tool.\nMake sure to SAVE after confirming these settings!\n\nLeave the default Target Seed (hex) and Seed +\\-.\nSet Advance Range to 1000 to 5000.

(OPTIONAL: Select a desired Nature)\n\nOnce these settings are correct, click Submit to search for all the\npotential Shiny Pokemon you could attempt to RNG.\nNOTE: Your Browser might freeze momentarily while calculating, just\nwait. If anything pops up click \"Wait\" or \"Continue\".\n\nWhen the search is complete, there should be a table of potential\nShiny Seeds and Advances.\nOur Target is Grimer, but these results are showing all possible Shiny Pokemon.\nIn order to better filter the results to only see your target species you can check the Filter box next to Species.\n\nKeep this tab open, because we'll also need it to look up which\nPokemon we actually hit during RNG attempts!\nThere might not be any Shiny results that match the Encounter Slot\nyou're searching for, especially for the rarest encounters.\nEncounter SlotRarity\nSlot 040%\nSlot 140%\nSlot 215%\nSlot 34%\nSlot 41%\n\nIn this case, you can either increase the Seed +/- to 50 (which will\nincrease maximum wait time on the Title Screen) OR alter the\nsettings above to a different SOUND or BUTTON MODE, and Submit\nthe search again. Remember to update those settings in-game as well!\n\n  NOTE: Changing 'A Button' or 'Held Button' in Calibration\n  For general purposes, changing only SOUND or BUTTON MODE should provide\na sufficient variety of Shiny targets. However, if using particularly\nstrict Nature or IV filters and receiving no results, you can change \"A\nButton\" and \"Held Button\" to check even more seeds.\n\n\"A Button\" refers to the final A press on the Title Screen. This can be\nchanged to either START or L (L=A).\n\nSTART would mean pressing and holding START on the Title Screen\ninstead of the A Button.\n\nL (L=A) only works when BUTTON MODE is L=A, and means pressing and\nholding L on the Title Screen.\n\n\"Held Button\" refers to optional buttons that can be held during the\nboot-up sequence and intro cutscene.\n\nFor beginners, STARTUP SELECT is the only option that requires no\nspecial timing.\n\nSTART UP A and the BLACKOUT Held Buttons will be covered in an\nADVANCED guide.\n\nSTARTUP SELECT means holding SELECT before booting the game, and\nholding it until the File Load screen appears. You must continue holding\nit, even while doing your final button press &amp; hold on the Title\nScreen.\n\nOnce you've chosen your desired target Shiny, change the Target Seed\n(hex) to match the Seed, and update the Advance Range to 500\nadvances above and below your target.\n\nIn our example, we found a Shiny Grimer on seed A372 and\nAdvance 4014. Which means the Advance Range becomes 3514 to 4514.\nNow we update EonTimer for this target as well.\nTimer Setup\nOpen EonTimer 3.0.0-RC6, and switch over to the Custom Tab (C).\nClick the (+) button at the bottom, and add two timer sections.\nMake the Unit of the first timer ms, and the second timer\nAdvances.\nEnter the ms value from the Seed into the first Target box.\nEnter the Advances value of the Shiny into the second Target box.\n\nThen click the gear icon in the bottom left, and make sure your\nconsole setting is correct.\nGBA, GameBoy Player and GBI use the \"GBA\" setting.\nDS and 3DS (open_agb_firm) use the \"NDS - Slot 2\" setting.\nThe tools are now set up for...\nThe First Attempt\nPosition your character in front of the body of water you wish to Fish\nin.\nMake sure the Fishing Rod required for your Target is registered to\nSELECT in the KEY ITEMS menu.\n\nOpen your in-game settings and double check that they match the\nSOUND and BUTTON MODE settings for the target Seed at the top of\nG3 Calibration.\nSave your game, and then Power Off the system.\nThe startup sequence is slightly different depending on the console\nbeing used.\nReference the following Boot method for your system of choice.\n\n  Boot Methods\n  NDS: Press A on \"Start GBA Game\" from the DS Home Screen\n\nOFFICIAL GAMEBOY PLAYER: Press the \"Change Game Pak\" button, and\nconfirm to Hard Reset\n\n3DS OPEN_AGB_FIRM: Press A to boot the Fire Red/Leaf Green ROM file\n\nGAMEBOY INTERFACE (GBI): Hold and Release the RESET button, or use\nHard Reset Button Combo\n\n(Note: GBI boot times and frame-rate are identical to real GBA, so use\nGBA in the system selector)\n\nGBA: Flick the Power Switch\n\nGBA users might find this difficult. In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n1. Boot the game and click Start on EonTimer at the same time.\n2. Wait for the ENTIRE Introduction to play, DO NOT PRESS ANY\nBUTTONS or SKIP.\nYour first timer should be long enough to make it to the Title Screen.\n3. When the timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st of 6\nbeeps.\n4. ON THE 6TH BEEP, PRESS and HOLD the A Button.\n5. Once the File Load screen appears, you can release all buttons\nand press A to load your save.\n6. Mash B to skip past any \"Previously on...\" screens.\n7. Mash SELECT to pull out your Fishing Rod.\n8a. Wait for the dots to pass, and if it says \"A POKéMON's on the\nhook!\" then WAIT HERE\n8b. Wait for the dots to pass, and if it says \"Not even a\nnibble...\" then RESET\n9. When the second timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st\nof 6 beeps.\n10. ON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to Reel in the Pokemon.\n11. Capture the Pokemon\n\n  Note: Why RESET after the first cast? Why not just keep casting?\n  Every cast of the Fishing Rod introduces extra RNG advances.\nCalibrating to Pokemon caught on anything other than the first cast will\nskew Advances results and lead to inconsistency.\n\nUnfortunately Sticky Hold and Suction Cups didn't gain the benefit of\nincreasing fishing hook likelihood until Emerald, so FireRed and\nLeafGreen are stuck with the base odds of getting a hook on first cast.\n\nIt's not impossible to use casts beyond the first for general\ncalibration, but be aware that the Advances number won't be entirely\naccurate. Ultimately once you're close to your target, you'll only want\nto use first casts to guarantee consistent results on the Advances hit.\n\nInitial Calibration\nAfter catching, open the Pokemon's summary and look at the Nature\nand Stats.\n\nOpen the G3 Calibration tool, set Shiny back to Any,\nselect your caught Species, select the Nature, Gender, and then enter Stats into\nthe IV Calculator in the following order: \nLEVEL HP ATK DEF SPA SPD SPE\n\nThis should automatically populate the Stat ranges with the best guess\npossible given the inputted data.\nClicking Submit will search for all the potential Pokemon this could\nbe.\nSuper Rod Pokemon are a high enough level that you should get a clear\nresult or no result, but Good Rod or Old Rod might be low enough to\nyield multiple results. Use a Rare Candy to gain a level and refine\nthe IV calculations.\nIf the first search yields no results, this is expected sometimes.\nFishing Pokemon in FireRed and LeafGreen can be generated using\ndifferent Encounter Methods.\n\n  Note: What are Methods?\n  Methods result in different sets of IVs for a Pokemon, from the same RNG\nAdvance. However, they have the same PID, which means they will still be\nShiny and have the same Nature.\n\nWhich Method you get on a Wild Pokemon is out of the player's control\nin FireRed and LeafGreen. Method 1 is the most common, but it's\npossible to hit Method 2 or Method 4 instead-- so it's\nimportant to check all three for Wild RNG manipulation.\n\nThis setting can be changed in the Method dropdown in the\ntool. Every time we search for which Pokemon we hit, it's important to\ncheck All Wild Methods.\n\n\nIf you get NO results on ANY METHOD, then increase Advance Range to\n1000 advances above and below target, and increase Seed +/- to 50.\nIncrease levels with Rare Candy as necessary. If this still yields no\nresults, there was an error in the attempt and you must check all your\nsettings and try again. Double check in-game settings match the settings\nin the Calibration tool, and that the timers match your target\nseed/advance.\nOur Level 23 Magikarp lines up with Wild 1, Encounter Slot 2 for\nCeladon City Super Rod. So we can confidently say the first attempt\nhit Seed A372 and Advance 3923. \n\nEnter the millisecond and Advance values from the result that matches your \ncaught Pokemon into EonTimer and then click Update.\nThe values in Calibration should update accordingly, and you can now\nturn off your game and begin a second attempt.\nAttempts &amp; Adjustment\nRepeat the same steps of:\n\n\nPerforming the startup sequence with EonTimer\n\n\nCapturing the Pokemon\n\n\nEntering Stats, Checking Methods, and Leveling Up as needed to reach\na single search result\n\n\nInputting the Seed ms, and Advance into EonTimer and clicking Update\n\n\nOnce your calibration is within the range of +/- 50ms for the Seed,\nand +/- 3 for Advances you can confidently narrow the search range\nin Calibration to speed up attempts.\n\n\nLower Seed +/- to 10 and Advance Range to 20 advances below and\nabove your target.\n\n\nWith this smaller search range, you should be able to get a single\nresult after only inputting the stats of the Pokemon.

However, the method in this guide minimizes those frustrations\nby pre-calibrating timers on a Gift Pokemon first.\nThe game uses the same exact method for generating the Roamer as it does\nfor Gifts. Therefore the seeds, advances, and timings needed to hit a\nspecific PID are the same. The IV bug only takes effect after the\nRoaming Pokemon is set in the save file.\nWe will be going for Shiny Entei, because I chose Bulbasaur at the\nbeginning of the game. Squirtle would instead release Raikou as the\nroamer, and Charmander would release Suicune.\nYou must know your Secret ID to find viable targets, which would be\ndone during the Shiny Starter RNG process. If you are on a completed\nsave and DO NOT know your Secret ID, there are methods to deduce\nit using a previously caught Shiny, using glitches to read it from a\nPokemon, or view it via extracting Save Data and using a tool like\nPkHex.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements:\n\n\nPokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green (any language)\n\n\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite, Nintendo 3DS w/\nopen_agb_firm\n\n\nWindows / Mac OS / Ubuntu PC\n\n\nIn-game Requirements:\n\n\nEnough Game Corner Coins to purchase a Pokemon\n\n\nRetrieved the SAPPHIRE from the Sevii Island post-game\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party\n\n\nMax Repels to find the Roamer (50+ recommended)\n\n\nMaster Ball (DO NOT EVEN THINK OF ATTEMPTING THIS WITHOUT IT)\n\n\nPokeballs to capture the Roamer\n\n\nPokémon to aid in capture (Fast Sleep/Mean Look User)\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc6\n\n\nTen Lines Calibration\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nPre-Calibration\nAs discussed in the Introduction, due to the Roamer IV bug it's more\nefficient to utilize a Gift Pokemon to pre-calibrate EonTimer for use\nwith the Roamer.\nThe best Pokemon to use for this approach is a Gift from the Game\nCorner.\nRefer to the FireRed &amp; LeafGreen Static RNG\nGuide for\nhow to do this process successfully. When completed you should have\nalready received a Shiny, and your EonTimer will already be calibrated\nto re-use on the Roamer.\nThe timing and PID generation are identical between the Game Corner\nGifts and the Roamer release, so in theory, using the same timer should\nproduce the exact same Shiny result.\nI've successfully RNG manipulated this Timid Shiny Abra from Seed\nAB33 and Advance 3303, with the following EonTimer calibration and\nwill be using the same timer for Entei.\n\nThe First Attempt\nPosition your character next to CELIO in the One Island Pokemon\nCenter. You must be at the point in the game where you have received the\nSAPPHIRE, but not turned it in to CELIO.\n\nOpen your in-game settings and double check that they match the\nSOUND and BUTTON MODE settings for the target Seed at the top of\nG3 Calibration.\nSave your game, and then Power Off the system.\nThe startup sequence is slightly different depending on the console\nbeing used.\n\n  Boot Methods\n  NDS: Press A on \"Start GBA Game\" from the DS Home Screen\n\nOFFICIAL GAMEBOY PLAYER: Press the \"Change Game Pak\" button, and\nconfirm to Hard Reset\n\n3DS OPEN_AGB_FIRM: Press A to boot the Fire Red/Leaf Green ROM file\n\nGAMEBOY INTERFACE (GBI): Hold and Release the RESET button, or use\nHard Reset Button Combo\n\n(Note: GBI boot times and frame-rate are identical to real GBA, so use\nGBA in the system selector)\n\nGBA: Flick the Power Switch\n\nGBA users might find this difficult. In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n1. Boot the game and click Start on EonTimer at the same time.\n2. Wait for the ENTIRE Introduction to play, DO NOT PRESS ANY\nBUTTONS or SKIP.\nYour first timer should be long enough to make it to the Title Screen.\n3. When the timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st of 6\nbeeps.\n4. ON THE 6TH BEEP, PRESS and HOLD the A Button.\n5. Once the File Load screen appears, you can release all buttons\nand press A to load your save.\n6. Mash B to skip past any \"Previously on...\" screens.\n7. Talk to CELIO and get to his last text box \"Thanks to you, my dream\ncame true...\"\n8. When the second timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st\nof 6 beeps.\n9. ON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to Release the Roamer\n\nFinding the Roamer\nAfter releasing the Roamer for the first time, you must locate it in the\nWild Grass of Kanto.\nEvery time you change maps, the Roamer will move as well. There's no way\nto trade over a Raikou, Entei, or Suicune early in order to get the\nPokedex entry-- so you must brute force the first encounter to check.\nRoute 2, just south of Pewter City is the best for this.\n\nUse a Max Repel, and run around in the grass for 10-20 seconds. Make\nsure the Pokemon in the lead of your Party is lower than 50, but higher\nthan Level 5.\nAfter 10-20 seconds of running around in the grass with no encounters,\nyou can quickly enter and exit the gatehouse to Viridian Forest to\nrelocate the Roamer.\nThis can take quite a while, so make sure to bring a lot of Max Repels.\nEventually you will get an Encounter with your Roamer.\n\nThis guide will assume you have a Master Ball to use for capturing and\nchecking the Roamer when you miss the Shiny. It's not strictly\nnecessary to capture and calculate each time, because we\npre-calibrated using the Game Corner Abra.\nHowever, it can be useful to be able to identify your missed attempts to\nknow when it's potentially time to recalibrate due to human error or\nfatigue.\nIdentifying Non-Shiny Roamer\nOpen Calibration and make sure the Game/Sound/Button\nMode/System settings are correct for your Target Seed.\nInput your Target Seed.\nSet Seed +/- to 5.\nSet Minimum Advances to 20 before your Target. (Ex. Target 3303 -&gt; Minimum 3283)\nSet Maximum Advances to 20 after your Target. (Ex. Target 3303 -&gt; Maximum 3323)\nSet Encounter Method to Static 1.\nSet Category to Roamer.\nSet Pokemon to your target Legendary Beast.\n\nSelect your Roamer Species and Nature, then enter the Stats you see\nin-game into the IV Calculator.\n\n\nThanks to the Roamer IV bug, you should see the IV ranges for\nDEF/SPA/SPD/SPE all get set to 0 - 1, but the Calibration tool takes this into account.\nHit Submit to get the search results for your caught Roamer.\n\n\nThis first example Entei wound up having multiple results, and\nunfortunately there's no way to narrow it down further from here. I was\neither on-seed, 3 advances late OR 16ms early on seed, and 20 advances\nlate.\nI chose to not adjust and trust in the pre-calibrated timer from the\nGame Corner Abra, because it's more likely that I hit my seed and was\nonly off by 3 frames.\nAdjusting EonTimer comes down to your personal preference, but either\nSeed or Advances being less than 3 away from the target is most likely\nwithin human error.\nAt this stage, it's reasonable to Update only the Seed ms in\nEonTimer, if you're consistently late or early on seed. You can\nsafely leave the Advances Hit input for Advances empty in\nEonTimer and click Update. It will update only the Seed ms\nCalibration and leave the Advances Calibration unchanged.\n\nIt's also generally a good practice, to only adjust Advances based\non attempts that hit the Target Seed. Adjusting both too often makes\nthings less consistent over multiple attempts, by creating a constantly\nmoving target.\n\nIt's also not a bad idea to re-calibrate off the Gift Pokemon again, if\nresults really start to drift and it becomes too difficult to identify\nthe Roamer hit.\nEventually, you'll hit the Target Seed and Advance and see the\nShiny!\n\nAnd if you're not immediately throwing a Master Ball, there are a few\nextra things to worry about when it comes to...\nCapturing the Shiny Roamer\nOnce the Shiny Roamer has been found, it's a good idea to let it run\nimmediately on first encounter.\nFirst, because it's now permanently Shiny and unlocked in your Pokedex,\nso you can safely Save the game and prepare to find and capture it\nnext time.\nSecond, because there's another bug with the Roamer in FireRed and\nLeafGreen that can make your Shiny Roamer permanently disappear.\nBoth Raikou and Entei know Roar at Level 50, and if they use it against\nyou, it counts as the Roamer being fainted instead of fleeing normally.\nIf this happens you must reload the save to prevent permanently\nlosing the Shiny Roamer.\nFleeing can be prevented by:\n\nArena Trap and Shadow Tag abilities.\nUsing the move Mean Look or Block (lasts until Switch)\nPutting the Roamer to Sleep (temporary)\n\nRoaring can be prevented by:\n\nSoundproof and Suction Cups abilities\nUsing the move Ingrain or Imprison (lasts until Switch)\nUsing the move Encore or Taunt (temporary)\nPutting the Roamer to Sleep (temporary)\n\nSmeargle can use a combination of Mean Look, Ingrain, Spore, and\nFalse Swipe to serve as an all-in-one Roamer capture helper.\nHowever, it cannot be found natively in Kanto and only appears in\nColosseum and Emerald's post-games.\n\nAdditionally, turning in the SAPPHIRE is what enables cross-gen trading.\nSo you'd have to receive the Smeargle from another copy of FireRed and\nLeafGreen that already has trading unlocked.\n\nThere is no other perfect option, but thankfully any progress you make\non its HP will remain after each encounter, as long as it doesn't use\nRoar and delete itself.\nHere are some No-Trading Required options that can be used to\nvarying degrees of effectiveness.\nParasect: Spore + False Swipe (Egg Move w/ Scyther)\nJynx: Lovely Kiss + Mean Look + Taunt\nTangela: Sleep Powder + Ingrain\nButterfree: Compound Eyes + Sleep Powder\nHaunter: Mean Look + Hypnosis + Taunt\nSnorlax: Block + Yawn\nRemember, because of the Roamer IV bug, the Speed stats will\nentirely depend on Nature.\nYou must be faster than the Roamer to stop it from fleeing with Sleep,\nMean Look or Block.\nSpecies-SpeedNeutral+Speed\nSuicune819099\nEntei94105115\nRaikou108120132\n\nYou can calculate your odds of success with your ball-of-choice using\nthis catch odds calculator from dragonflycave.com\n\nOnce it's at 1 HP and Asleep, with enough patience you'll eventually\nbeat those 1.53% odds of capturing the Roamer in a standard PokeBall...\nGood luck!\nNext Steps...\nCongratulations! That's the end of Intermediate for FireRed and\nLeafGreen. With everything learned up to this point, it should be\npossible to successfully RNG manipulate a quick Shiny for most things in\nthe game.\nThe only exceptions are Unowns and Breeding, which are unique enough to\nwarrant being considered Advanced-level. Those lessons are coming soon,\nalong with RNG manipulation for competitive Pokemon using special\nheld-button seeds and the Teachy TV.

The focus will be on acquiring Shiny Pokemon,\nwithout concern for competitive Natures or IVs.\nThis is Intermediate-Level because you cannot Save inside the Safari\nZone. This means you must start from inside the Safari Gate, and use\nconsistent movement techniques to minimize RNG interference.\nWild Grass tiles, Surfing tiles, NPCs and even Item Pokeballs on the map\ncause the RNG to advance more than it would when standing in one place\nwaiting for the timer.\nThe Safari Zone also includes three exclusive Pokemon that cannot be\ncaught anywhere else: Chansey, Tauros, and Kangaskhan.\nUnfortunately we can only RNG manipulate the appearance of these rare\nShiny Pokemon, the capture itself still comes down to luck.\nBe prepared to hit your target multiple times before actually securing\nthe capture.\nWe will be going for Shiny Tauros in Safari Zone West, which is a\nrare spawn that requires the most specific walking route.\nYou must know your Secret ID to find viable targets, which would be\ndone during the Shiny Starter RNG process. If you are on a completed\nsave and DO NOT know your Secret ID, there are methods to deduce\nit using a previously caught Shiny, using glitches to read it from a\nPokemon, or view it via extracting Save Data and using a tool like\nPkHex.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements:\n\n\nPokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green (any language)\n\n\nGameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS or DS Lite, Nintendo 3DS w/\nopen_agb_firm\n\n\nWindows / Mac OS / Ubuntu PC\n\n\nIn-game Requirements:\n\n\nSave in the entrance to the Safari Zone\n\n\nPick up all Items on the ground in Safari Zone (they add extra RNG\nadvances)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party\n\n\nAny Pokemon with the move Sweet Scent\n\n\n\n\nAt least one Rare Candy (5+ is helpful, but not required)\n\n\n  List: Earliest available Sweet Scent users in FireRed &amp; LeafGreen\n  \n\nBulbasaur: Chosen as Starter\na.

Don't evolve to Weepinbel, who learns at Level 33\n\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc6\n\n\nTen Lines Calibration\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nN/A\n\nThe Guide\nFinding a Shiny Target\nTo get started, open Lincoln's Ten Lines Calibration here.\nSelect your Game, and then leave the Sound, L, A, and Held\nButton settings on the default values of Mono, L=A, A, and None.\nMake sure to select your System, as the boot-up times and\nframe-rates are slightly different based on the console, and the tool\naccounts for those.\n\nOpen the settings in-game, and change Sound and Button Mode to\nmatch these settings in the tool.\nMake sure to SAVE after confirming these settings!\n\nLeave the default Target Seed (hex) and Seed +\\-.\nSet Advance Range to 2500 to 5000. This means your maximum wait time\nwill be ~2 minutes. The minimum is 2500 because we cannot save inside\nthe Safari Zone, so extra travel time is necessary.\nEnter your Trainer ID and Secret ID.\nSet Method to Wild 1.\nSet Category to Grass if the target is found in\ngrass/cave. Surfing if the target is in water.\nSelect your Location and the target Pokemon.\nSelect Star/Square from the Shiny Filter. This will filter to all\npossible Shiny targets.\nSquare Shiny is only relevant if sending to Sword/Shield, but the\noption is there.\nSet Nature Filter to Any. (OPTIONAL: Select a desired Nature)\n\nOnce these settings are correct, click Submit to search for all the\npotential Shiny Pokemon you could attempt to RNG.\nNOTE: Your Browser might freeze momentarily while calculating, just\nwait. If anything pops up click \"Wait\" or \"Continue\".\n\nWhen the search is complete, there should be a table of potential\nShiny Seeds and Advances.\nThere might not be any Shiny results that match the target Pokemon\nyou're searching for, especially for the rare encounters on the route.\nEncounter SlotRarityEncounter SlotRarity\nSlot 020%Slot 65%\nSlot 120%Slot 75%\nSlot 210%Slot 84%\nSlot 310%Slot 94%\nSlot 410%Slot 101%\nSlot 510%Slot 111%\n\nIn this case, you can either increase the Seed +/- to 50 (which will\nincrease maximum wait time on the Title Screen) OR alter the\nsettings above to a different SOUND or BUTTON MODE, and Submit\nthe search again. Remember to update those settings in-game as well!\n\n  NOTE: Changing 'A Button' or 'Held Button' in G3 Calibration\n  For general purposes, changing only SOUND or BUTTON MODE should provide\na sufficient variety of Shiny targets. However, if using particularly\nstrict Nature or IV filters and receiving no results, you can change \"A\nButton\" and \"Held Button\" to check even more seeds.\n\n\"A Button\" refers to the final A press on the Title Screen. This can be\nchanged to either START or L (L=A).\n\nSTART would mean pressing and holding START on the Title Screen\ninstead of the A Button.\n\nL (L=A) only works when BUTTON MODE is L=A, and means pressing and\nholding L on the Title Screen.\n\n\"Held Button\" refers to optional buttons that can be held during the\nboot-up sequence and intro cutscene.\n\nFor beginners, STARTUP SELECT is the only option that requires no\nspecial timing.\n\nSTART UP A and the BLACKOUT Held Buttons will be covered in an\nADVANCED guide.\n\nSTARTUP SELECT means holding SELECT before booting the game, and\nholding it until the File Load screen appears. You must continue holding\nit, even while doing your final button press &amp; hold on the Title\nScreen.\n\nOnce you've chosen your desired target Shiny, change the Target Seed\n(hex) to match the Seed, and update the Advance Range to 500\nadvances above and below your target.\n\nIn our example, we found an Encounter Slot 9 Shiny on seed 3D93 and\nAdvance 2762. Which means the Advance Range becomes 2262 to 3262.\nNow we update EonTimer for this target as well.\nTimer Setup\nOpen EonTimer 3.0.0-RC6, and switch over to the Custom Tab (C).\nClick the (+) button at the bottom, and add two timer sections.\nMake the Unit of the first timer ms, and the second timer\nAdvances.\nEnter the ms value from the Seed into the first Target box.\nEnter the Advances value of the Shiny into the second Target box.\n\n\nThen click the gear icon in the bottom left, and make sure your\nconsole setting is correct.\nGBA, GameBoy Player and GBI use the \"GBA\" setting.\nDS and 3DS (open_agb_firm) use the \"NDS - Slot 2\" setting.\nThe tools are now set up for...\nThe First Attempt\nBecause Tauros can only be found in Safari Zone West, we need to\nfollow specific movement to reach the grass in that Zone with as few\nsteps as possible. If you're targeting Pinsir or Chansey in\nSafari Zone Entrance, this is less of a concern because you can just\nrun to the first available Grass tile.\nAlso make sure to pick up any Item PokeBalls on the ground in the Safari\nZone before starting, as they cause extra RNG advances while running\naround.\nThe following Movement Route is 77 Steps in total. You can use a Repel\nbefore saving in the Safari Zone Entrance, and taking 24 steps to avoid\nthe Wild Encounters on the 4 Surfing Tiles. If done correctly the Repel\nshould expire on the steps right before the final Grass tile.\n\nYou will need a Lead Pokemon of at least level 41 to avoid all\nencounters on these tiles, as the Surf spawns go up to Level 40. It\nshould be noted that this extra text box from the Repel expiring will\nadd time, so if your Shiny Target is very close to the minimum of 2500\nyou may not be able to make it to Sweet Scent in time.\n\n\nOpen your in-game settings and double check that they match the SOUND\nand BUTTON MODE settings for the target Seed at the top of G3\nCalibration.\nSave your game, and then Power Off the system.\nThe startup sequence is slightly different depending on the console\nbeing used.\nReference the following Boot method for your system of choice.\n\n  Boot Methods\n  NDS: Press A on \"Start GBA Game\" from the DS Home Screen\n\nOFFICIAL GAMEBOY PLAYER: Press the \"Change Game Pak\" button, and\nconfirm to Hard Reset\n\n3DS OPEN_AGB_FIRM: Press A to boot the Fire Red/Leaf Green ROM file\n\nGAMEBOY INTERFACE (GBI): Hold and Release the RESET button, or use\nHard Reset Button Combo\n\n(Note: GBI boot times and frame-rate are identical to real GBA, so use\nGBA in the system selector)\n\nGBA: Flick the Power Switch\n\nGBA users might find this difficult. In this case, you can add a 3rd\nsection to EonTimer's Custom tab at the top, and set it to 5000ms. This\ncreates what we call a pre-timer that will count down 5 seconds,\nending in 6 beeps before the actual seed timer starts. Using a pre-timer\nallows you to time your power-switch flip with the 6th beep, removing\nthe need to coordinate a switch-flip and button press.\n\nThe general flow of each attempt is as follows:\n\n\nBoot the game and click Start on EonTimer at the same time.\n\n\nWait for the ENTIRE Introduction to play, DO NOT PRESS ANY\nBUTTONS or SKIP. Your first timer should be long enough to make it to the Title Screen.\n\n\nWhen the timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st of 6\nbeeps.\n\n\nON THE 6TH BEEP, PRESS and HOLD the A Button.\n\n\nOnce the File Load screen appears, you can release all buttons\nand press A to load your save.\n\n\nMash B to skip past any \"Previously on...\" screens.\n\n\nHold Up and proceed to Enter the Safari Zone\n\n\nMove to the Grass containing your target as fast as possible.\n\n\nPress START once you reach the target Grass tile, and open POKEMON\n\n\nHover over SWEET SCENT in your Pokemon's Field Move list.\n\n\nWhen the second timer is close to completion, you will hear the 1st\nof 6 beeps.\n\n\nON THE 6TH BEEP PRESS A to use SWEET SCENT.\n\n\nAttempt to Capture the Pokemon (Sometimes you just won't be able\nto)\n\n\n\n  Note: What can I do to maximize Safari Zone captures?\n  There are advanced strategies involving the use of Bait and Safari Ball\npatterns to maximize the odds of capturing specific encounters. You can\nfind that guide here.\n\nUnfortunately, even using optimal strategies you will fail to capture\nyour encounter most of the time. If you fail to capture you are forced\nto reset and try again.\n\nInitial Calibration\nAfter catching, open the Pokemon's summary and look at the Nature\nand Stats.\n\n\nOpen the Calibration tool, set Shiny back to Any,\nselect your caught Species, select the Nature &amp; Gender, and then enter Stats into\nthe IV Calculator in the following order: LEVEL HP ATK DEF SPA SPD SPE\n\nThis should automatically populate the Stat ranges with the best guess\npossible given the inputted data.\nClicking Submit will search for all the potential Pokemon this could\nbe.\nSafari Zone Pokemon are a high enough level that you should get a clear\nresult or no result. In the unlikely event there are multiple\nresults, use a Rare Candy to gain a level and refine the IV\ncalculations.\nIf the first search yields no results, this is expected sometimes.\nWild Pokemon in FireRed and LeafGreen can be generated using different\nEncounter Methods.\n\n  Note: What are Methods?\n  Methods result in different sets of IVs for a Pokemon, from the same RNG\nAdvance. However, they have the same PID, which means they will still be\nShiny and have the same Nature.\n\nWhich Method you get on a Wild Pokemon is out of the player's control\nin FireRed and LeafGreen. Method 1 is the most common, but it's\npossible to hit Method 2 or Method 4 instead-- so it's\nimportant to check all three for Wild RNG manipulation.\n\nThis setting can be changed in the Method dropdown in the\ntool. Every time we search for which Pokemon we hit, it's important to\ncheck All Wild Methods.\n\nIf you get NO results on ANY METHOD, then increase Advance Range to\n1000 advances above and below target, and increase Seed +/- to 50.\nIncrease levels with Rare Candy as necessary. If this still yields no\nresults, there was an error in the attempt and you must check all your\nsettings and try again. Double check in-game settings match the settings\nin the g3 calibration tool, and that the timers match your target\nseed/advance.\nOur Level 25 Exeggcute lines up with Wild 1, Encounter Slot 2\nfor Safari Zone West. So we can confidently say the first attempt\nhit Seed 8651 and Advance 2935.\nNow that Exeggcute has been confirmed, we can enter the millisecond\nand Advance values from the result that matches our Encounter\nSlot into EonTimer and then click Update.\n\nThe values in Calibration should update accordingly, and you can now\nturn off your game and begin a second attempt.\nAttempts &amp; Adjustment\nRepeat the same steps of:\n\n\nPerforming the startup sequence with EonTimer\n\n\nCapturing the Pokemon\n\n\nEntering Stats, Checking Methods, and Leveling Up as needed to reach\na single search result\n\n\nInputting the Seed ms, and Advance into EonTimer and clicking Update\n\n\nOnce your calibration is within the range of +/- 50ms for the Seed,\nand +/- 3 for Advances you can confidently narrow the search range\nin Calibration to speed up attempts.\nLower Seed +/- to 10 and Advance Range to 20 advances below and\nabove your target.\n\nWith this smaller search range, you should be able to get a single\nresult after only inputting the stats of the Pokemon. If you still get\ntwo or more results, use Rare Candy and Encounter Slots to narrow it\ndown again.\nAt this point, you must repeat attempts until you successfully hit\nyour Target Seed and Advance.\nThis requires two frame perfect inputs, so it can be difficult.\nOnly Update the calibration of EonTimer, if you notice you are\nconsistently hitting early or late over multiple attempts. The optimal\nCalibration will have you landing sometimes early, sometimes late.\nNow it's a matter of overcoming human error to succeed.\nEventually, you will hit your Shiny! Good luck capturing!\n\nNext Steps...\nAfter you've dealt with the inconsistencies of the Safari Zone, why not tackle some of the other more, shall we say, frustrating Manips.

This is something you cannot do in\nFireRed/LeafGreen, and Emerald!\nAt first these games might seem very limited when doing RNG Manips,\nsince you're restricted to the set initial seed of 5A0.\nThis happens when the internal battery dies in Ruby &amp; Sapphire, so, if\nyou want to do these manips, you have to make sure this message appears!\n\nYou either have to wait for this to happen naturally, which it probably\nhas if you've not replaced it, or open your game up and remove the\nbattery yourself.\nDespite the set seed, these games are also extremely versatile thanks to\nsome advanced techniques, like Painting, Pokemon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire,\nand more!\nUsing them, I've gotten tons of Competitive Shiny\nPokemon! Not to mention probably hundreds of random shinies.\n\nOf course I didn't get these Pokemon instantly-- it took a lot of time\nand practice to hone the skills I have!\nAnd that's what this course is designed to do! I'll walk you from the\nmost basic RNG to the toughest ones I know how to do in Ruby &amp; Sapphire,\nso you too can have perfect, shiny, competitive Pokemon without any\nglitches or hacks!\nSo, if you're ready to get started, head over to our R/S Trainer ID &amp; Starter Manip tutorial!\n-- im a blisy ._.\n","description":"A brief passage on makes R/S RNG unique & fun!","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/introduction/","title":"R/S RNG Manip Introduction"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/static-manip/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter setting up your Trainer ID and Secret ID and successfully RNG\nManipping your Starter Pokémon, Manipping a Static encounter is the\nnext logical step. This is, largely, the same process as the Starter\nPokémon, but with more variety in situations and circumstances.\nThis pool of Pokémon includes all of the Legendary Pokémon and\nvarious overworld encounters, like Kecleon or Electrode.\n\nNOTE: This guide will NOT INCLUDE ROAMING Latios &amp; Latias. They will have\na separate guide in the Intermediate section for them.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokémon Ruby or Sapphire with a Dead Internal Battery (any\nlanguage)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA\nEmulator, or Pokémon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire.\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nSave at the location directly in-front of whichever Pokémon you wish\nto capture or receive.\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\nPokeballs to capture it, if it's a capture. \n\n\nPokémon to aid in capture, such as a false swipe user or a\nspore user.\n\n\n5-10 Rare Candies.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Ruby Painting Seed or Sapphire Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a Nintendo DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 5A0, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, I covered how to manip it here.\n\n\n  Note: What is Offset?\n  Offset, sometimes called Delay, in Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Fire Red, and Leaf Green is how\nmany RNG Advances occur after you press A to encounter or receive your\nPokémon, but before the Pokémon is generated.\n\nIn the past, we would consult a list that told you what this value was\nfor various encounters. We no longer do this, and no guide here will\nreference such lists. This is for two main reasons.\n\n\nAttempting to hit your target Pokémon, missing it, and calibrating\nyour miss is an integral part of the RNG Process. Figuring out a\nspecific legendaries Offset will only take one of these. Because we\nteach RNGing this way, Offset no longer serves a purpose.\n\nMany people would refrain from performing certain manips if they did\nnot know a Pokémon's Offset. Such hesitance is bad, we do not want\npeople thinking they CANNOT do a manip without an arbitrary list\nsomewhere, when they absolutely can.\n\n\nIn short, Offset is a social construct we as a community have moved\npast the need for.\n\nSet Method to Static 1.\nFor Category &amp; Pokemon, select whatever your target is. The categories are self explanatory.\nIn this example, I will be using Regirock, who is in the Legends Category.\nHowever, I will provide\ninfo for every Static encounter in Ruby &amp; Sapphire so you can apply\nit to your specific situation.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you'd like, and also select if you want a Shiny.\n\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\n\nFor these Pokémon Shininess occurs on the same Advances as the\nStarter Pokémon we RNG'd in the previous\nguide.\nOnce all your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokémon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time. There are ways to\ncircumvent this issue, but they are difficult techniques covered in our\nAdvanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have no results, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, etc.\nI will be aiming for 7660, the same as I did for the Starter\nPokémon. This is one of Ruby &amp; Sapphires main benefits.\n\nWith a Dead Internal Battery, and the ability to RNG Manip your\nTrainer ID and Secret\nID,\nyou can pick a very early Advance for your Shiny and hit it over\n&amp; over again on different Pokémon. This allows you to learn the basics\nof RNG Manips through repetition, while getting a bunch of shinies!\n\n  Note: But, aren't all these Pokémon clones?\n  Many people discount / belittle this type of RNG Manip because it\nproduces a lot of PID Clones and can produce True Clones as\nwell. But, what are these things, what's the difference between them,\nand does it even matter?\n\nA PID Clone is often described as RNG Manipping two different\nspecies of Pokémon on the same RNG Advance. This means the two\nPokémon will have the same Nature, IVs, and Shiny Status,\nfor the most part.\n\nA True Clone is RNG Manipping the same species of Pokémon on the\nsame RNG Advance. This means the two Pokémon Nature, IVs,\nAbility, Gender, and Shiny Status, for the most part.\n\nWhile rare, sometimes a Pokémon the same RNG Advance will spawn\nwith a different Method. This keeps the Pokémons PIDs the same,\nbut their IVs will be different. Is this a clone? Are the other ones\nclones? Does it even matter?\n\nWell, that's entirely personal. Not only is it possible for this to\nhappen entirely naturally, it's actually very likely to. If you're\nplaying without Manips on Emerald or Dead Battery Ruby &amp;\nSapphire, the game's RNG is not functioning properly anyway. You\ncan and will hit the same RNG Advance, randomly, without knowing\nit.\n\nNo Official legality checks have ever cared about these types of\n\"clones\", and neither has anything in-game. So they are all 100% safe to\ntransfer.\n\nI have had a lot of fun playing the game this way, doing many shiny only\nnuzlockes or playthroughs. But, if you find this gets stale, do not\nworry, late into the Intermediate and Advanced guide sections,\nwe will be covering ways around this.*\n\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Static Manip!\nStatic Manip\nTo get started with the Static Manip, you want to save in-front of\nwhichever Pokémon you want to receive. Here I am in front Regirock.\n\n  Note: Castform, Kyogre, Groudon, Lileep, &amp; Anorith\n  These five Pokémon have slightly unique save positions and requirements\nthan the rest of the Static encounters.\n\nCastform: Castform is given to you after you defeat Team Aqua or\nMagma in the Weather Institute, directly after a battle. Make sure to\nenter this battle with a party of 6 Pokémon, that way, after the battle,\nthe Scientist who gives Castform to you will not do so because your\nparty is full. We want to do this so we can receive Castform later,\nwithout the battle interfering with the RNG Manip. Once you do this,\nreturn to the Scientist with a party of 5 Pokémon and save in-front of\nhim to perform the Manip.\n\nKyogre &amp; Groudon: These Legendaries have text which is triggered by\na Step Forward rather than an A Press. Save one step away from\nthis tile.\n\nLileep &amp; Anorith: The two fossils are generated when you receive\nthem from the Scientist, not when you give them to him. So first you\nmust give him your fossil, then walk out of the building so he finishes\nreviving them, and walk back to him and save the game.\n\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 7660. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nYou don’t need to touch Refresh Interval or Precision Calibration. Now it’s time to attempt the manip. \nWe are almost ready to begin. You need to know two more things.\n\n\nWHEN to press A to encounter the Pokémon. Usually it's the final text box\nbefore receipt / encounter.\n\n\nIF there is text at all. \n\n\nHere is a list so you can be certain of when to Press A, and if there is text.\n\n  List: Final A Press Locations\n  \n\nTreecko: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nTorchic: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nMudkip: Do you choose this POKéMON? YES/NO\n\n\nLileep: The fossil was an ancient POKéMON. LILEEP, it was!\n\n\nAnorith: The fossil was an ancient POKéMON. ANORITH, it was!\n\n\nCastform: It might be an odd way of thanking you, but take this POKéMON.\n\n\nWynaut (Egg): Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with this here EGG!\n\n\nBeldum: Take the POKé BALL? YES/NO\n\n\nKecleon: The startled POKéMON attacked!\n\n\nVoltorb: Press A in front of it\n\n\nElectrode: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRegirock: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRegice: Press A in front of it\n\n\nRegisteel: Press A in front of it\n\n\nLatias (Southern Island): Press A in front of it\n\n\nLatios (Southern Island): Press A in front of it\n\n\nKyogre: XXX's BLUE ORB suddenly began glowing!\n\n\nGroudon: XXX's RED ORB suddenly began glowing!\n\n\nRayquaza: Press A in front of it\n\n\nList compiled by ZSpica\n\nIf the Pokémon you are aiming for says Press A in front of it, click the \"No Text Box\" Tab.\n\nText Box\n At this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nIf your Pokémon HAS text boxes in the list above, talk to whatever NPC /\nEncounter you're in and get to the final box of dialogue. Then, wait\nthere until Eon Timer finishes counting down. Pictured Below is what\nwaiting for Groudon looks like:\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\n \nNo Text Box\n \nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nIf your Pokémon DOES NOT have dialogue, press Start to bring up the\nMenu. This will freeze any NPCs nearby, who may cause extra unwanted\nRNG Advancements. Dialogue boxes do this naturally, so those Static\nPokémon do not need this extra step. Pictured below is how I wait for\nRegirock.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. On the 3rd beep Press B to Close the Menu, and on the\n6th beep, when the timer finishes, Press A to start the\nencounter.\n \n\n\nAnd we can see it's not shiny like I wanted. It's likely you also missed\nyour target. We're going to have to check the Pokémons summary screen to\nfigure out what RNG Advance we landed on. To do that, we'll have to\ncatch it if it's an encounter.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you are aiming for a Shiny and didn't get\none, just use the Masterball for a catch if you have it. You will not be\nkeeping the Pokémon, so it just speeds the process up.\nOnce you can view the Pokémons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nStatic Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 7660. So I set it to 6660. \nAlso set Max\nAdvances to 1000 above your target. In my case, this would be 8660\nThis will generate Pokémon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nThen, set Shininess back to Any. All IVs should also be 0 to 31. Set Nature to what the Pokemon you received had. In my case it's a Hardy Regirock, who has no\nGender.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokémon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokémon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, click the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for your Pokemons next level will appear.\n\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target. In my case, I only got one possibility near me.\nIf you have no results at all, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\n\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the\nAdvance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The\ncalibration will change, and you can try again.\n\nNow repeat the process from Static Manip until you get your desired\nPokémon.\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokémon you are\naiming for. The Regirock for this guide took me 3 attempts, including\nthe first adjustment run.\n\n\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  If on the attempt after your adjustment run, you find you're only one\nor two Advances off, try not adjusting. 1 Advance is only 16\nmilliseconds, well within the margin of human error.\n\nAlternatively, if you find yourself dancing around it, consistently\nbeing 1 Advance early or late several times, try adjusting anyway.\nSometimes breaking out of the cycle, even if it makes you more late or\nearly, can help!\n\nLastly, have patience! This is a skill to hone, maybe it takes you 10,\n15 tries now. But a couple weeks from now, maybe 5! Hope you're having\nfun!\n\nNext Steps...\nIf you enjoyed this process and want to do more RNG Manips, I would\nsuggest moving on to Wild RNG. While the general process and structure\nof the manip (Wait for timer, push button at right time) is not\ndifferent, finding what Advance you landed on is slightly more\nchallenging. Once you have Wild RNG Mastered, you'll be able to take on\nsome more advanced manip challenges.\n","description":"How to quickly get ANY static encounter shiny!","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/static-manip/","title":"R/S Static Encounter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/trainer-id-starter-manip/":{"body":"Overview\nRuby &amp; Sapphire are the best place to begin your RNG Journey within Generation 3, thanks to this combined manip. In this guide I'll be covering how to manip your Trainer ID and Secret ID, which determine when your shiny targets are available, and we will follow that up with a Shiny Starter manip, so you can be sure you did the Trainer ID manip correctly. \nEven if your main goal is not to use RNG Manips to shiny hunt, this will still serve as a way to teach you the fundamentals you'll need to understand any Manip you want to do in the future. \nRecommended Setup\n\nPokémon Ruby or Sapphire with a Dead Internal Battery (any language)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA Emulator, or Pokémon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire. \nWindows 10/11 PC\n\nTools Used\n\nTen Lines \nJS-Finder IDs \nEonTimer 3.0.0-rc.6 \n\nVideo Examples\n\nim a blisy ._. \nPapa Jefe \nDislcaimer: These video examples showcase the same process, but with different tools\n\nThe Guide\nTrainer ID Setup\nBefore we can start any manips, we have to know what Trainer ID and Secret ID we want. What we're going to do is pick a specific target advance to make shiny. \nWhich one you pick is up to personal preference– It's all about IVs, Nature, &amp; Gender. Also, the higher advance you pick, the longer the wait you will have. Be careful not to go for too short of a wait, though, as you need enough time to be able to reset the game and press A at the correct time. I would not pick a target below 1000. \nTo pick your target, go to the Ten Lines website, and click Calibration.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Ruby Painting Seed or Sapphire Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a Nintendo DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 5A0, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nInitial Advances and Max Advances cover your starting point &amp; how many advances you want generated after that, respectively. Leave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nTrainer ID &amp; Secret ID are something we'll be manipulating in this guide, so for now leave them blank.\nSave the Category as Starters, and pick one of the three Hoenn Starter Pokémon. I'll choose Mudkip. \nLastly we have what IVs &amp; Nature you want. Make sure to leave the Shiny dropdown as Any. Also, the more picky you are with this info, the less options you will have. I recommend aiming for no more than 3 Perfect IVs with the desired nature. \nOnce you've filled everything out, click Submit. If you get no results, lower some of your IV Ranges, or remove them entirely. \nI aimed for a Mudkip with Perfect Attack, Defense, and Speed, with an Adamant Nature. Here is how my window looks:\n\nYou may have more results than I do. If that's the case, pick whichever one you want. Once you've made your selection, highlight the PID and use your computer's copy command.\n\nNow, we'll go to Lincolns TID/SID Generator.\n\nFor Initial Seed, set that to 5A0. \nWe also want to set Initial Advances to 5000 here. This is because during the TID Manip, we have to do the entire intro of the game, and 5000 Advances is about the fastest you can do that section in. \nMax Advances should be set to 15,000.\nSelect the PID bubble. Then, box to the right of the PID bubble, paste the PID we copied from Gen 3 Calibration. \nWhen we click Generate here, it will use that PID we pasted to generate multiple different Trainer ID and Secret IDs that will make any Static Encounter, Gift Pokémon, Legendary, or Roamer Shiny if we receive/encounter it on the advance we picked. \n\nI will be aiming for Advance 7660, which is a Trainer ID of 14002 and a Secret ID of 29131. At this point, our prep is complete. You should have a Trainer ID and a Starter Pokémon you are aiming for ready. So it's time to move on to the TID Manip. \nTrainer ID Manip\nTo get started with the manip, we’re going to boot up our copy of Ruby or Sapphire, and open the Eon Timer 3.0 App on our computer. \nIn Eon Timer, click the 3 tab, and make sure the Calibration Box is set to 0. \nAlso, make sure to put your Target Advance from the IDs section into the Target Frame box in Eon Timer. Mine was 7660. \nPretimer is optional. \nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the countdown to your target TID. This requires you to soft reset your game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer. \nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will soft reset the game to, then the countdown for the TID Begins. I’ll be using this method for the remainder of the guide. \nYour timer should look something like this:\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nYou don’t need to touch Refresh Interval or Precision Calibration. Now it’s time to attempt the manip. \nStart Eon Timer, and when the pretimer countdown hits 0, soft reset the game. You’ll notice Eon Timer starts beeping as it approaches 0. By default, it beeps 6 times. The goal is to Soft Reset on the 6th beep itself. \nAt this point, play through the intro where you pick your gender and name yourself until you’re at the final text box, pictured below. \n\nWhile here, we just wait for Eon Timer to finish counting down. Once it gets near the end, it’ll beep 6 times again. The goal is to Press A here on the 6th Beep. \nOnce the overworld loads, open up the start menu and click your Trainer Name to check your ID on the Trainer Card. \n\nAnd as you can see here, it’s not the one I wanted. You also probably didn’t get it. What’s going on here? Well, as mentioned in the Introduction page, the gen 3 games move at around 60 frames per second, and different manips have different offsets and delays. This is no different, so I’ll show you how to account for your own personal timing, and any delay incurred by the game itself in the next section. \nTrainer ID Adjust\nThe first thing we’re going to do post attempt is head to Lincolns TID/SID Generator again. We can leave everything the same as our setup. But we’re going to click the TID bubble, and unclick the PID one. \nThen, we’ll type out what TID we just got in-game, and hit generate. You should only get 1 result using these parameters.\n\nYou can see the TID I got was after 7654 advances, which is slightly before 7660. The way we adjust for this is simple– In Eon Timer, paste 7654 from the advances column into the Frame Hit box, and click update.\n\nAfter you click update, the Calibration box will be changed. This value is updated automatically, no need to worry about it. \nWith the update done, you hit Start on Eon Timer and try again, with the exact same procedure as described in the Trainer ID Manip section. \nThis is a precise endeavor, the timing is 1/60th of a second, remember. So have patience, and with enough attempts you will get the ID you want. \n\nOnce you do, it’s time to use that Trainer ID to get a shiny starter! \nStarter Setup\nThe process for the Starter Manip is very similar to the Trainer ID Manip. Time your button press with Eon Timer, if you miss, calibrate and try again. The main difference will be in how you identify your miss. We'll have to use the Starter Pokemons stats!\nLet's search for our Shiny Target that we picked out earlier. The settings of the Calibration Tab will be identical to what we did in Trainer ID Manip, except for two things.\nFirst, enter your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID you just RNG Manip'd into their respective boxes. \nWe also want to change the Shiny drop down to Star/Square instead of Any. Then, let’s hit Submit.\n\nYou’ll notice that, yes, the target I selected showed up (Adamant Mudkip with 3 Perfect IVs), but there’s many other targets available to me as well! This is because a Trainer ID and Secret ID do not only make the one target you picked out shiny. They will make THOUSANDS of shinies available to you. \nAnd you can see, on the typical 5A0 seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire, I have 3 that are available to me in under two minutes. \nSo, pick any of these targets to be your first. I’ll be aiming for advance 7660, as it has 3 Perfect IVs &amp; an Adamant Nature, which are great for Mudkip.\nYou may be wondering what the Star/Square Distinction is in the Shiny Column. This is for Pokémon Sword and Shield. That game has two distinct shiny animations, and this column tells you if it will be the animation with stars, or with squares. It makes no visual difference in any other game.\n\nOkay, at this point, we have the ability to search for a target, we know our Trainer ID should theoretically produce a shiny, so let’s confirm we’re correct.\nStarter Manip\nTo get started with the starter manip, you want to play through the intro until you are in front of Professor Birch's bag, and save the game. \n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the  Advances Column into the Target Frame box. In my case, it is the same number I used for my Trainer ID Manip. Also, change the value in the  Calibration box to be 0 again. \nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different, because the game delays generating whatever you’re manipping differently, based on what it’s generating.Your Eon Timer should look something like this, but with your target advance instead. \n\nWe are once again all set to begin. Start Eon Timer, and when the pretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game. \nThen, get all the way up until the Yes/No box on the starter you intend to choose, and hover over Yes while you wait for the timer to count down. Pictured below\n\nWhen the timer finishes counting down, hit A to start the battle with Poochyena. \n\nWe can check the summary screen and see that we missed our target once again. Just like with the Trainer ID Manip, we are going to have to learn how to calibrate missing our target. \nStarter Adjust\nTo figure out which Mudkip we hit, we’re going to have to figure out its IVs and use that to search. \nFirst, though, let’s set up Calibration for a search. \nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 7660. So I set it to 6660. \nThen, set Shininess back to Any. All IVs should also be 0 to 31. Set Nature to what the starter you received had. In my case it’s Relaxed.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\nThe IV Calculator looks for Level, then HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. In that order. So enter the stats of your starter as they appear. \n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your stater. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You will likely get a few different results, however, one should be much closer than the rest. In my example, 7662 is only 2 Advances away from my target. The next closest would be a whopping 5000 Advances away. \nDespite each advance only being 1/60th of a second, that adds up to about 83 seconds. There is no way I could be over 1 minute late. So, by process of elimination, 7662 is where I landed. \nAside from just distance, you can also use Gender to determine where you landed. You'll notice the Mudkip I have is Male, and so is the target I received according to Ten Lines.\n\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the Advance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The calibration will change, and you can try again. \n\nNow repeat the process from Starter Manip until you get your desired Pokémon. \nIf you find yourself dancing around your target, being 1 or 2 advances late or early repeatedly– that’s okay. The timing is strict, do not worry about it. Just keep practicing and you will eventually succeed. \n\nNext Steps\nIf you enjoyed this process and want to do more RNG Manips, I would suggest moving on to Static RNG. It is the same type of RNG Manip as the Starter Pokémon, but with a couple of different targets available to choose from. \nAlternatively, if you want to jump straight into doing some Wild Pokémon RNG, that’s a feasible path as well. It is slightly more difficult to determine where you land during this manip, but the timing is not any more difficult. \n","description":"How to get any SID you want in R/S, & a shiny starter!","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/trainer-id-starter-manip/","title":"R/S Trainer ID & Starter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/wild-manip/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter RNG Manipping your first Static Pokemon, you may be looking for\nsome variety.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Ruby Painting Seed or Sapphire Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a Nintendo DS for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 5A0, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\n\n\n  Note: Sweet Scent Offset?\n  In our Static RNG Guide, I covered why we do not list offsets\nanymore. But you may be wondering why not cover Sweet Scents\nOffset, since it should be the same everywhere?\n\nThe reason is because Sweet Scent's offset changes based on which\narea you are in, and what game you are in. And again, learning how to\ncalibrate after missing your Target once is an important step in the\nprocess.\n\nIn short- Don't stress about Offset. It's not useful to us, learning\nhow to Calibrate will teach you how to handle delays.\n\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, I covered how to manip it here.\nFor Method, Select Wild 1.\n\n  Note: What are Methods?\n  Methods result in different sets of IVs for a Pokemon, from the same RNG\nAdvance. However, they have the same PID, which means they will still be\nShiny and have the same Nature.\n\nWhich Method you get on a Wild Pokemon is, for the most part, out of the player's control\nin Ruby and Sapphire. Wild 1 is the most common, but it's\npossible to hit Wild 2 or Wild 4 instead-- so it's\nimportant to check all three for Wild RNG manipulation.\n\nNext, think of what Pokemon you want to RNG\nManip, because its Species, Location, &amp; Category will all\nbe important to this section.\nFirst is Category. We can choose\nbetween Grass &amp; Surfing. Functionally, they are the same, but\nthey have different Locations available to them. The Fishing Rods &amp; Rock Smash will be covered in our Intermediate guides.\nAfter we select Category, we will select our Location in-game where we want to catch our Pokemon.\nThen, we select our Pokemon in the Pokemon Dropdown. In addition, check the Filter box. This will tell Ten Lines to only search for that species.\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature you want. And also select if you want a Shiny.\n\nI will just be aiming for a simple Shiny Duskull on Route 121.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce all your fields are set, click Submit. You should get several results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Wild RNG is not the same as Static\nRNG in the sense that you will always have the same targets\navailable to you. Sometimes trainer IDs may produce multiple shiny\ntargets of different species on nearby Advances. So I encourage you\nto leave the Pokemon Dropdown blank to see if you have any other\nTargets available to you.\nThis Trainer ID unfortunately only has Advance 7657 available as a\nShiny, which, while being a different Advance, is the same PID &amp;\nIVs as our Starter / Static targets. You probably have the same\nPID available to you, but you also may not. It's up to you to\ninvestigate.\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokemon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time. There are ways to\ncircumvent this issue, but they are difficult techniques covered in our\nAdvanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have none, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, Different Species, or\nChange Routes if your Pokemon is available on another one.\nI will be aiming for Advance 7657. You can see here the earlier\nAdvances I had available to me via Static RNG are missing. I\nonly have the Adamant Target, so this is not 100% the same.\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Wild Manip!\nWild Manip\nTo get started with the Wild Manip, you want to save in-front in the\nLocation you want to RNG Manip in. Here is me saved on Route 121.\nYour area in the Location does not matter.\nAlso MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A POKEMON WITH SWEET SCENT IN YOUR PARTY. In\nmy case, I am using Oddish. You can use any Pokemon with that move.\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 7657. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating. Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nYou should also click the gear icon, and make sure your console setting is correct. \nregular GBA and GBA Games on the DS have slightly different frame rates. \nGBA: 59.7275 fps\nNDS - Slot 2: 59.6555 fps\nHaving it set incorrectly will make longer timers inconsistent relative to the actual game. \nIf you’re playing on unofficial hardware or emulator, stick with GBA as this is usually the default.\n\nYou don't need to touch Refresh Interval or Precision\nCalibration.\nWe are all ready to begin!\nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nGet to the overworld, and press Start to bring up the Menu. This\nwill freeze any NPCs nearby, who may cause extra unwanted RNG\nAdvancements.\n\nThen, head into your Pokemon Menu. Press A on your Sweet Scent user,\nand hover over the Sweet Scent option.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter\nusing Sweet Scent.\n\nAnd we can see not only is the Pokemon not shiny, it's not even the\ncorrect species.\nIt's likely you also missed your target. We're going to have to check\nthe Pokemons summary screen to figure out what RNG Advance we landed\non. To do that, we'll have to catch it.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you are aiming for a Shiny and didn't get\none, just use the Masterball for a catch if you have it. You will not be\nkeeping the Pokemon, so it just speeds the process up.\nOnce you can view the Pokemons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nWild Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 7657. So I set it to 6657. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 1000 above your target. So again, in my case, this is 8657. \nThis will generate Pokemon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nChange the Pokemon to the species you\ncaught.\nThen, set Shininess back to Any. All IVs should also be 0 to 31. Set Nature to what the Pokemon you received had. In my case it's an Adamant Oddish.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, hit the Enter/Return button, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target. In my case, I only got one possibility near me.\nIf you have no results at all, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\nIf you get no results after that, there is always the chance you hit\na Different Method. While rare, it can happen. Be sure to check\nMethods Wild 2, and Wild 4 if you get no results for\nTHOUSANDS of Advances.\n\n\n  Note: Two identical results\n  Finding the correct Advance you landed on can be difficult if you\ndo not have the ability to level up your Pokemon &amp; it is a low level\nencounter. Sometimes, you will end up with a situation like this:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it's impossible to tell which Oddish I received.\nThey are IDENTICAL. When this is the case, repeat the steps from\nWild Manip until you land on a Target where you get only one\nresult. This is not common, but it can happen.\n\nAlso, make sure you're looking at all the details. Species &amp;\nLevel can be different while all else is identical. Just keep it in\nmind.\n\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the\nAdvance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The\ncalibration will change, and you can try again.\n\nNow repeat the process from Wild Manip until you get your desired\nPokemon.\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. The Duskull for this guide took me 3 attempts, including the\nfirst adjustment run.\n\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  Remember to always check other wild methods when searching for what target you hit!\nIf you find your results don't make sense, that could be the key!\n\nThis is really not that different from the Static RNG you should've done!\n\nNext Steps...\nCongratulations! You've finished all the Beginner RNG Manips for\nRuby &amp; Sapphire! At this point, I'd suggest delving into some\nmore complicated subjects in our Intermediate section, or trying\nPokemon Emerald, which is very similar to this.\nIntermediate will contain a lot of familiar techniques showcased\nhere, but with various different challenges. Things like Pokemon Box\nRuby &amp; Sapphire, Fishing, Rock Smash, The Safari Zone are\nall more challenging than these manips, while still being \"Press A at\nRight Moment\". It's other things that complicate them.\nAdvanced will contain extremely challenging manips with Multiple\nFrame Perfect Inputs, for those who want to go the extra mile to gain\nPerfect IV Shiny Pokemon / Very Rare Pokemon. Things like Painting\nRNG, Egg RNG, &amp; WishMakr Jirachi.\n","description":"A guide to basic Wild Encounter manips in R/S.","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/beginner/wild-manip/","title":"R/S Wild Encounter Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/":{"body":"","description":"Find out how to contribute to AdiDoks.","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/","title":"Intermediate"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/roaming-pokemon/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter getting a handle on the basics of RNG, you might be interested in\nsomething more unique or challenging. The Ruby &amp; Sapphire Roamer RNG\nManip is perfect for this because of two unique challenges it has.\n\n\nThe roamers IVs are glitched, and are always going to have 4 of them\nbe 0. HP is generated normally, then attack can be a maximum of 7.\nEverything else will be 0. So all you really have to be able to\nidentify your Latios or Latias is their nature and HP stat. Because\nof this, the only real purpose to do this manip is to aim for a\nshiny.\n\n\nFinding and catching the roamer can be quite tedious, so even though\nthe execution of the manip is not difficult, the amount of time this\ntakes can be quite high.\n\n\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Ruby or Sapphire with a Dead Internal Battery (any\nlanguage)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA\nEmulator, or Pokemon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire.\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nSave at the location directly in-front of the TV in your parents\nhouse.\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\nPokeballs to capture it.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nFor Game, select Ruby Painting Seed or Sapphire Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a GBA for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 5A0, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, I covered how to manip it here.\n\n\n  Note: What is Offset?\n  Offset, sometimes called Delay, in Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Fire Red, and Leaf Green is how\nmany RNG Advances occur after you press A to encounter or receive your\nPokémon, but before the Pokémon is generated.\n\nIn the past, we would consult a list that told you what this value was\nfor various encounters. We no longer do this, and no guide here will\nreference such lists. This is for two main reasons.\n\n\nAttempting to hit your target Pokémon, missing it, and calibrating\nyour miss is an integral part of the RNG Process. Figuring out a\nspecific legendaries Offset will only take one of these. Because we\nteach RNGing this way, Offsets no longer serves a purpose.\n\nMany people would refrain from performing certain manips if they did\nnot know a Pokémon's Offset. Such hesitance is bad, we do not want\npeople thinking they CANNOT do a manip without an arbitrary list\nsomewhere, when they absolutely can.\n\n\nIn short, Offset is a social construct we as a community have moved\npast the need for.\n\nSet Method to Method 1.\nThen you will choose your Pokemon. The Latis are in the\nRoamer Category.\nIn this example, I will be using Latios in Ruby, but Latias in\nSapphire is no different!\nLastly is the Pokemons IVs &amp; Nature you'd like, in addition to\nShininess.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, the Roaming Latis in Ruby &amp; Sapphire (not\nEmerald) are bugged to always have Defense, Special Attack, Special\nDefense, and Speed IVs be 0. In addition, the attack IV cannot be higher\nthan 7. Because of this, do not be very strict with your IV Parameters!\n\nOn top of that, the Latis only have one ability. This means we're really\nonly able to pick our HP IV, Nature, &amp; if it's shiny or not.\nThis is not an issue with the Lati generation, however. It is generated\nnormally using Method 1. This means you can use the ID/Starter RNG\nAdvance you chose in the Beginner\nGuides.\nThe IVs you SHOULD have are actually always in your save file, and you\ncould extract them with glitches or hacks, if you wanted. The issue is\nhow the game extracts said Lati from your save file when a battle\nloads.\n\nIn order to keep the Pokemon consistent across multiple\nbattles, the game generates a Lati when you talk to the TV, then stores\nits IVs and PID in your save file. And everytime you see it, it rebuilds\nit based on said information.\nBut this rebuilding code is bugged, and does not load all the IVs. This\nproblem also exists in FRLG, but was fixed for Emerald.\n\nBecause of all of this, I will just be going for a simple Shiny.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce all your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\n\nTen Lines does a great job at showcasing the glitch in action! You'll\nnotice the HP and Nature values of your typical shiny Advances, but\neverything else is 0. Let's look at what the Southern Island Lati looks\nlike, as a comparison.\n\n\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokemon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time.\nThis means you have to loosen your restrictions on what you want. Accept\na worse HP IV, or a Worse Nature, etc.\nI will be aiming for Advance 2133. It should be quick attempts, &amp;\nQuiet Boosts special attack!\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Roamer Manip!\nRoamer Manip\nTo get started with the Roamer Manip, you want to save in-front of the\nTV in your parents house. This event only spawns immediately after you\ndefeat the elite 4. You CANNOT\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 2133. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance.

I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nAlso make sure to double check your console in EonTimers settings!\n\nI selected GBA, since I am doing this on a Gameboy Player. A regular\nGBA, and GBA Emulators should also select this. But if you're on a DS\nor DSLite, select NDS - Slot 2.\nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nAfter that, press A until you're loaded into the game and talk to the TV\nand get to the final box of dialogue. Then, wait there until Eon Timer\nfinishes counting down.\n\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to release the roamer.\n\nNow, we have to go find it!\nFinding the Roamer\nRoute 118 is the most common route the roamer can appear on, so I head\nto this spot on Route 123, by the berry master's house.\n\nPut a repel on &amp; make sure the lead pokemon of your party is above level\n30, but below level 40. I use a level 33 Dunsparce for mine. Then, go to\nthe grass and bunny hop on the Acro Bike for a little while. If the\nroamer doesn't appear, I go back to Route 123 so the route sign drops\ndown, and head back to 118 and repeat.\n\nDo this until the roamer spawns.\n\nAnd we can see it's not shiny like I wanted. It's likely you also missed\nyour target. We're going to have to check the Pokemons summary screen to\nfigure out what RNG Advance we landed on. To do that, we'll have to\ncatch it!\nIt's worth mentioning, if you are aiming for a Shiny and didn't get\none, just use the Masterball for a catch if you have it. You will not be\nkeeping the Pokemon, so it just speeds the process up.\nOnce you can view the Pokemons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nRoamer Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search. This is the tricky part! We only\nhave Nature, HP &amp; Attack as information to guide us.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 2133. So I set it to 1133. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 3133, which is 1000 Advances after my target. \nThis will generate Pokemon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\nAll IVs should be 0 to 31, and all of the drop downs should say\nAny, except Nature. Set that to what the Roamer you received\nhad. In my case it's a Calm Latios.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nAfter entering the stats, you can hit Submit.\nAs you can see, because the of the IV Bug, I have two potential Latios. What can we do about this?\nWell, if you have Rare Candies to raise the Roamers level, we can make the IV\nRanges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's safe\nto use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTypically, narrowing just a little bit will help A LOT. However, with\nthe glitched IVs here, I think it's important to narrow the IV Ranges as\nmuch as possible. I recommend getting exact IVs for HP and Attack. It\nonly took me 3 candies to do so.\n\nTo account for the extra levels, hit the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result.\nIf you have no results at all, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Max Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. \nDo this until you get at least 1 result.\nIf you get more than that, there isn't much you can do to gain more\ninfo.\n\nHowever, let's look at how many Latios' similar to mine exist, and where\nthey are in relation to it.\n\n\nAs you can see, the closest Calm Latios with my IVs is over 10,000\nAdvances away. The closest two Latios here are these:\n\n\nWhich are over 800 advances away from each other. 800 advances is 13\nseconds. You are not going to be that early or late.\n\nAll that to say; If you use the Nature of the Roamer &amp; always narrow the\nIVs EXACTLY &amp; you get more than 1 result, it's safe to assume you\nhit the pokemon closest to your target Advance.\nNow we need to update Eon Timer. In the Frame Hit box, put the\nAdvance that you determined you landed on, and click update. The\ncalibration will change, and you can try again.\n\nNow repeat the process from Roamer Manip until you get your desired\nRoamer!\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. Remember to have patience. This Latios literally only took\nme 2 attempts; the calibration run, then I succeeded. But that took me\nover 2 hours. This is because of how difficult it is to find the\nroamers when they're not yet on your map.\n\n\nOnce the Shiny Roamer has been found, it’s a good idea to let it run immediately on first encounter.\nIt’s now permanently Shiny and unlocked in your Pokedex, so you can safely Save the game and prepare to find and capture it next time with whatever setup you deem best. \n\n  Note: Some tips\n  The worst part of this manip is FINDING the dang Lati.\n\nI really reccomend trading over a Lati beforehand for the dex entry, otherwise this manip is tedious.\n\nI'd also highly reccomend either using the masterball, or having catching Pokemon at the ready!\n\nOther than that, this manip isn't too different to your normal static encounter!\n\nNext Steps...\nIf you enjoyed this process and want to do more RNG Manips, I would\nsuggest moving on to Rock Smash RNG. While the general process and\nstructure of the manip (Wait for timer, push button at right time) is\nnot different, hitting your Advance the first time is very tedious,\nand requires a LOT of patience, just like this Roamer Manip.\n","description":"A guide on what makes Roamer RNG different from static!","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/roaming-pokemon/","title":"R/S Roamer Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/rock-smash-rs/":{"body":"Overview\nAfter getting a handle on the basics of RNG, you might be interested in\nsome Pokemon who cannot be obtained with standard wild RNG Manipulation.\nWhile niche, in Ruby and Sapphire there are two Pokemon who are\nexclusive to the Smashable Rocks.

Open\nthe Ten Lines website, and select the Calibration tab.\n\nYou will be on a new tab. Here, we've got some settings to fill out. \nFor Game, select Ruby Painting Seed or Sapphire Painting Seed, whichever you're playing. Painting Seed refers to a more difficult technique, that will be covered in Advanced, but I will cover how to use this website without doing that.\nFor Console, select whichever you're playing on. I am on a GBA for this tutorial, but the process is the same across all systems.\nFor Target Seed we'll put 5A0, this is the default seed for Ruby &amp; Sapphire with a Dead Battery. \nSeed+- &amp; Offset should be set to 0. \nLeave Minimum Advances alone, but change Maximum Advances to 100,000.\nInput your Trainer ID &amp; Secret ID into their respective fields. If you don't have yours, I covered how to manip it here.\n\n\nFor Method, choose Wild 1.\nSet Category to Rock Smash.\nFor the Location, you should select the one that has the Pokemon you\nwant to RNG Manip. There's only three available from Rock Smash in\nRuby &amp; Sapphire, so I'll list them out here.\n\nIf you want Nosepass, choose Granite Cave BF2.\n\nGeodude is in every location on this list, and Graveler is only\nin Victory Road BF1.\n\nAfter your location is selected, select which Pokemon you want from the\ndropdown menu. Also check the Filter box next to it, which makes Ten Lines only search for that species.\n\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature, you want. And also select if you want a Shiny.\n\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny.\n\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get\nseveral results, and have a window that looks like this:\n\nIf you get no results, that means no Pokemon within 100,000 Advances\nexists, which is about a 26 minute period of time. There are ways to\ncircumvent this issue, but they are difficult techniques covered in our\nAdvanced section.\nIn the meantime, if you have none, loosen your restrictions on what you\nwant. Accept some worse IVs, or a Worse Nature, no shiny, etc.\nI will be aiming for Advance 2559.\n\nWith our target picked out, we can move onto the Rock Smash Manip!\nRock Smash Manip\nTo get started with Rock Smash RNG Manips we need to head to our targets\nlocation &amp; destroy every rock but 1. In my case, I am going for\nNosepass, so we'll head to BF2 of Granite Cave.\n\nHere you can see what the area typically looks like.\n\n\nAnd here is what it looks like after I finished prepping.\n\nI even broke the rocks that are off screen.\n\n  Note: Spinning NPCs\n  Typically NPCs do not interfere much with basic &amp; intermediate RNG\nManips in Ruby &amp; Sapphire. And even if they did, there is not much you\ncan do about them. But, for Rock Smash, NPCs can be active &amp; moving\nduring the animation, and each Rock Smash rock counts as an NPC who\nspins in a random direction.\n\nThere's several interaction objects that do this, and you should do your\nbest to remove them from the screen if you can.\n\nThe list is as follows: Rock Smash Rocks, Strength Boulders, Cut Trees,\nVisible Items (shaped like Pokeballs), and Invisible Kecleons.\n\nThen, in Eon Timer, put the number from the Advances Column into the\nTarget Frame box in EonTimer. In my case, it is 2558. Also, make\nsure the value in Calibration is 0.\nFor every type of Manip, the amount of calibration will be different,\nbecause the game delays generating whatever you're manipping\ndifferently, based on what it's generating.Your Eon Timer should look\nsomething like this, but with your target advance instead.\nPretimer is optional.\nWhen set to 0, clicking Start on EonTimer will immediately start the\ncountdown to your target Advance. This requires you to soft reset\nyour game at the same time as clicking Start on Eon Timer.\nSetting this to 5000 will create a 5 second countdown, which you will\nsoft reset the game to, then the countdown for your Target Advance\nBegins. I'll be using this method for the remainder of the guide.\n\nAlso make sure to double check your console in EonTimers settings!\n\n\nI selected GBA, since I am doing this on a Gameboy Player. But if you're\non a DS or DSLite, select NDS- Slot 2\nAt this point, we're ready! Click Start Eon Timer, and when the\npretimer finishes on the 6th beep, soft reset the game.\nWhile Eon Timer counts down, immediately talk to the Rock and use Rock\nSmash. Go through the dialogue and wait on the X used ROCK SMASH.\nDialogue box, which is the final one.\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to start the encounter.\n\nYou most likely got no encounter! So, what do we do about this?\n\n\nThis is the challenging part. What we have to do is increment our target\nadvance by a random amount until we hit ANY Pokemon. That will give\nus enough intel to do our calibration.\n\nYou can go by 1, by 16, any arbitrary number. We're changing the Target\nFrame box in Eon Timer for this.\nI went 1 by 1 until I was on advance 2576 and saw a non-shiny Nosepass!\n\n\nOnce we get a Pokemon, we need to catch it. After that, we're going to\nhave to check the Pokemons summary screen to figure out what RNG Advance we landed on.\nIt's worth mentioning, if you have one, just use the Masterball for this\ncatch. You will not be keeping the Pokemon, so it just speeds the\nprocess up.\nOnce you can view the Pokemons summary screen, we can move onto how to\nadjust.\nRock Smash Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe’ll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset, and Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances. To be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 2576. So I set it to 1576. Also set Maximum\nAdvances to 3576. This will generate Pokemon spreads from 1000\nAdvances before your target, and 1000 after it.\n\nSelect which Pokemon you received. In my case it's Nosepass. Also be sure to keep the Filter Box checked so Ten Lines only searches for that species.\nAll IVs should be 0 to 31, and the shininess of the drop down should say\nAny. Set Nature to what the Pokemon\nyou received had. In my case it's a Timid, Nosepass.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then stats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo or forgot to enter something. \n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\n\nTo account for the extra level, push the Enter/Return button on your keyboard, and a new\nrow to enter the information for its next level will appear.\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration will be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon. \nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you get\nmore than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing more\nlevels in the IV Calculator.\nIf you do not have ANY rare candies and have more than one\nresult, it's generally fine to assume you hit the closest Advance\nto your target.\nIf nothing comes up, make sure to check the other wild Methods.\nIf you still have no results, expand your search range by decreasing\nInitial Advances by 1000, and increasing Maximum Advances by 1000,\nand click Submit again. Do this until you get at least 1 result.\n\nIn my case, I had to change the drop down to Wild 4 to get a\nresult.\n\n\nNow we need to calibrate. You may notice this is quite a distance away\nfrom your target! I had 2576 in EonTimer, but this Nosepass spawned\non 2766! That's a 190 Advance difference. So, what we'll do is\nput that into the Offset box in Ten Lines. Then, we'll clear all our\nfields except for Shiny, which we'll set back to\nStar/Square.\n\nChange the Pokemon back your target species, but keep\nLocation &amp; Encounter the same.\n\nChange Method back to Wild 1 if you have to, leave\nSeed as 5a0, change Initial Advances back to 0, and\nMaximum Advances back to 100,000.\n\nThen click Submit!\n\n\nYou'll see the same target Pokemon you aimed for earlier, but the\nAdvances are different! This is our new target we'll put into Eon\nTimer.\n\nNow repeat the process from Rock Smash Manip.\nIf you get no Pokemon spawn, just go up or down an Advance in your\nEonTimer target until you spawn something consistently.\n\nYou can see in Ten Lines, if you set shiny to any &amp; look around your\ntarget, that not every advance spawns a Pokemon.\n\n\nIf you get a Pokemon &amp; it's not shiny, we can repeat the calibration\nstep. Catch a Pokemon, calculate its IVs, and find where you landed.\n\n\nWe can see here that I hit 1 Advance early! So, I'm close!\n\nThis time, put what you hit into EonTimers \"Frame Hit\" box rather than\ndoing the more complicated adjustments we did earlier. Click update, and\ntry again!\n\nEventually, with enough attempts, you will land on the Pokemon you are\naiming for. This is a bit more tedious than other manips. Nosepass took\nme around 45 minutes to get with this methodology. And it's almost\nexclusively because of how long it took me to calibrate the rocksmash\ndelay.\n\n\n  Note: Some tips!\n  If on the attempt after your adjustment run, you find you're only one\nor two Advances off, try not adjusting. 1 Advance is only 16\nmilliseconds, well within the margin of human error.\n\nOn the contrary, if you find yourself dancing around it, consistently\nbeing 1 Advance early or late several times, try adjusting anyway.\nSometimes breaking out of the cycle, even if it makes you more late or\nearly, can help!\n\nLastly, have patience! This is a skill to hone, maybe it takes you 10,\n15 tries now. But a couple weeks from now, maybe 5! Hope you're having\nfun!\n\nNext Steps...\nUp next we'll be tackling the Safari Zone, and using it as a way to teach you the basics of Pathing in Ruby &amp; Sapphire.\nThis is something you really won't have to worry about in any other game! \n","description":"Guide to RNG Rock Smash Encounters in Pokemon R/S.","id":"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/rock-smash-rs/","title":"R/S Rock Smash Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/rs/intermediate/safarizone/":{"body":"Overview\nWhile learning RNG Manips in Ruby &amp; Sapphire, you may have noticed that,\ngenerally, the process is the same for everything. Save the game, reset,\ntry and get your target.\nBut there's certain areas in the game that you cannot do this in, most\nnotable of which is the Safari Zone! The Safari Zone has a bunch of\nPokemon that are exclusive to it, so if you want to catch 'em all,\nyou'll have to manip here at some point.\nYou might think the technique to Manip here would be to save outside the\nSafari Zone &amp; run to your desired location. However, running over grass\ntiles &amp; randomly moving NPCs will cause you to have inconsistent results\ninsofar as your calibration goes.\nWe have a solution, though! And it's a tough one-- Pathing &amp; Movement\ntechniques. In this guide I'll cover all of the ways you can prevent\nNPCs interfering with your RNG Manip in order to make moving from one\narea to another consistent.\nThis tutorial will serve as a basic use case for these techniques, which\nwill let you hit target Pokemon that would otherwise seem unfeasible to\nRNG Manip, or difficult to get in cases where you cannot save.\nIt is required reading for Advanced, which will make heavy use of these\ntechs.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon Ruby or Sapphire with a Dead Internal Battery (any\nlanguage)\nGameBoy Advance, Gameboy Player, Nintendo DS / DS Lite, GBA\nEmulator, or Pokemon Box Ruby &amp; Sapphire.\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nA Pokemon with Sweet Scent\n\n\nPokeBlock Case (required to enter Safari Zone)\n\n\nAt least one free space in your party.\n\n\n5-10 Rare Candies.

Below is a visual of which zone is which. This is\nDIFFERENT from how they're named in Emerald.\n\nAfter your location is selected, select which Pokemon you want from the\ndropdown menu. Also check the Filter box next to it, which makes Ten\nLines only search for that species.\n\nSelect the IVs &amp; Nature, you want. And also select if you want a\nShiny.\nI will just be going for a simple Shiny Natu in the NorthEast.\nShiny is set to Star/Square, which will show every potential Shiny.\nStar vs. Square doesn't matter in any game other than Sword &amp; Shield,\nbut Pokémon transferred from Gen 3 up to those games will retain their\nStar/Square Shiny status.\nOnce your fields are set, click Submit. You should get several\nresults, and have a window that looks like this:\n\n\n\n  Note: You need more time!\n  Picking a Target for the most part, is the same as it was in the Basic\nWild tutorial. However, because we are going to be traveling across the\nSafari Zone, we cannot aim for very low Advances. For example, a Wild\nAdvance of around 1000 is generally possible in normal routes.\n\nBut here, unless we're going for the SouthEast, we can't aim that low.\nJust something to keep in mind!\n\nOnce your target is selected, we're going to have to learn about how to\nhandle NPCs while moving from one area to another!\nMap Refreshing\nSo, how do NPCs even affect RNG Manips anyway? And, why haven't they\nbefore?\nNPCs can cause unwanted, extra, inconsistent RNG advances if they are\nthe type that either\n\n\nLooks around randomly\n\n\n\nMoves around randomly\n\n\nThese are the ONLY types that do anything to influence the RNG.\nGenerally, when you do an RNG Manip, you bring up the Start Menu. This\nprevents NPCs from moving completely, and so if there is one in your\nvicinity, they can't do anything.\nHowever, in this case, and in some cases we'll tackle in advanced, we\nare moving from one location to another, and during this time, these\nNPCs will move randomly. Unless every step we took was frame perfect,\nthe RNG will be at slightly different positions each time the NPCs load,\nso their movements will cause us to be slightly earlier or later in the\nRNG sequence.\n\n  Note: Random objects are NPCs\n  To get the player to be able to interact with them, gamefreak coded some\nobjects as NPCs that turn randomly. So your path may look safe but in\nreality you should be map refreshing.\n\nThese include Cut trees, Rock Smash Rocks, Strength Boulders, Pokeball\nitems, Invisible Kecleons, and Voltorb / Electrode Pokeballs.\n\nYou can eliminate Pokeball items, Kecleons, and Voltorb / Electrodes by\npicking up / battling them, but the others will always be along a given\nroute.\n\nThis can make calibration extremely difficult. However, there is a\ntechnique that lets us move while preventing NPCs from doing so, which\nis called Map Refreshing.\nIf you bring up the start menu, then go into a sub menu, like the party\nor bag, when you unpause the game you can take a few actions safely\nbefore the NPCs will move again.\nOutside Buildings:\n\n\n2 Steps Running\n1 turn + 1 Step running\n1 turn\n1 step walking\n\nInside Buildings:\n\n\n1 turn\n1 step walking\n\nAll of these actions have to be done within a couple seconds of closing\nthe menu before you bring up the pause menu again, but the timing is\nfairly lenient. You have 31 Advances after you unpause to take your\naction / actions.\nThis is around half a second of leeway before NPCs can move. I suggest\npracticing these movements in a place where there's several visible NPCs\nwho move randomly, and if they don't move at all, you know you're doing\nit right!\nNow I'll showcase what each movement looks like. Click the tab to see\nwhichever example you'd like.\n\n2 STEPS RUNNING\n \n \n1 TURN + 1 STEP RUNNING\n \n\n \n1 TURN\n \n\n \n1 STEP WALKING\n \n\n \n1 TURN INDOORS\n \n\n \n1 STEP WALKING INDOORS\n \n \n\nThe areas I showcase in these gifs are outside the Lilycove Pokemon\nCenter for the outdoor movements, and inside the Lilycove contest hall\nfor indoor movements.\n\nThese are great practice areas with tons of moving NPCs and space.\nWhenever you do a map refresh &amp; then move, the NPCs should not do\nanything. That's how you know you're doing it right.\nOnce you feel confident in your ability to execute, we can move on to\nplanning the path!\nPlanning the Path\nThere's a few things we need to do before we go onto our first actual\nattempt, and they're about planning our path through the Safari Zone.\nWe want to do 3 things\n\n\nTake the shortest path from start-&gt;finish. This is to make it so we\ncan take as much time as we need in traversal.\n\n\nAvoid grass, as wild encounters can cause extra advances.\n\n\nLearn where all the NPCs are. This will allow us to know where we\nhave to Map Refresh, and where we can move normally.\n\n\nTo do this, just walk around and observe the areas of the Safari Zone\nwhere you plan to catch your target.\nThe South East, however, is an Area you'll always be in, because that's\nwhere the entrance is. There's two moving NPCs here.\n\nNPCs will unload when you're 2 tiles away from them, but they can spawn\nback in if there's a tile they could move to.\nSo it's a safe bet to be 3 or more tiles away from their initial\nposition, vertically or horizontally. Here's an example from mGBA (a GBA\nEmulator) showing that the NPCs sprite is still loaded, but he's not\nvisible in-game.\n\n\nSo we know in this area we'll have to Map Refresh. But once we get to\nthe north a bit, we can walk normally.\n\nThis entire area is safe, which is nice, because we'll have to acro bike\nacross this obstacle. We can tell just because of how far the NPCs would\nbe, we don't need to check in emulators for everything.\nContinuing on, there's no randomly moving NPCs until we get to our target\ngrass patch.\n\nBecause I'm entering from the left of this area, I'll start Map\nRefreshing early enough to where he can never move.\nAt this point I practice the route to make sure I've got the movement\ndown, and that no NPCs will ever move.\n\nIf you're not going for the exact same path as me, you'll have to plan\nyour own route, but this is the one I've come up with. Be sure to\npractice WITH Eon Timer RUNNING! I have about a 2 minute timer, and by\nthe time I get to the final spot here I've got 20 seconds or so left\nbefore Eon Timer finishes.\nIt's also okay to not be perfect as long as the NPCs do not move. At one point during this path, I do 1 step running instead of 2 before pausing. This is inefficient, but NPCs won't move so it's okay. You also can wait as long as you need in the Start Menu or Party Menu. NPCs cannot move while they're up. So if you're stressed and need to wait an extra second, it's okay as long as you have the time.\n\n  Note: The timer is too tight\n  If you find that you cannot finish your path before your Eon Timer runs\nout, you either have to pick a new target advance, or find a shorter\npath to your target.\nOne example of a way to save time you can see in my full path. I avoid\ndoing the 1 Turn + 1 Step running movement option, because I find it a\nbit difficult. This causes me to waste some time by doing the turns\nindividually. Learning to be better at those could reduce how strict my\ntimer is.\nThere are other ways around this, but they'll be in our Advanced courses.\n\nWith the path planned and practiced, we're ready for our first attempt.\nFirst Attempt\nI'll keep this brief, because otherwise it should be the same as a\nnormal wild encounter, and you should be familiar with that process from\nour Beginner Courses.\nSet up Eon Timer as you normally would with your target Advance\nin the Target Frame box.\nAlso don't forget to put a Pre-Timer you use one. I will not be doing so\nin this guide.\n\nYour Eon Timer should look something like this, but with your target\nadvance instead. By this point in the tutorials, you should be\ncomfortable setting Eon Timer up on your own.\nAlso make sure to double check your console in Eon Timers settings!\n\nI selected GBA, since I am doing this on a Gameboy Player.\nSoft reset your GBA when you start Eon Timer (or reset when the\npre-timer finishes, if you're using it) and mash through the intro\nsequence until you're in the Safari Zone Lobby.\n\nWalk forward to enter the Safari Zone, and once you're inside it\nimmediately bring up the Start Menu. Use a repel from your bag to\nmake sure the final step into the grass doesn't trigger an encounter.\nDo a Map Refresh &amp; begin your path!\nBe cognizant of your timer, but once you've finished your path, sit in\nyour Party Menu until the timer runs out, and then hit Sweet\nScent.\n\nAs usual, my first attempt resulted in Pokemon who is not my target. The\nSafari Zone can be a bit frustrating, because these Pokemon can run away\nrandomly. If that happens, just start your manip over again!\nIn any case, once you've caught a Pokemon, we can move onto calibration!\nSafari Zone Adjustment\nTo figure out which Advance we hit, we're going to have to figure\nout its IVs and use that to search.\nFirst, though, let's set up Calibration for a search.\nWe'll leave Game, Console, Seed, Seed+/-, Offset,\nand Method alone, but we are going to change Minimum Advances.\nTo be about 1000 advances before our target.\nIn my case, I am aiming for 7656. So I set it to 6656. Also set\nMaximum Advances to 8656. This will generate Pokemon spreads from\n1000 Advances before your target, and 1000 after it.\n\nSelect which Pokemon you received. In my case it's Oddish. Also be\nsure to keep the Filter Box checked so Ten Lines only searches for that\nspecies.\nAll IVs should be 0 to 31, and the shininess of the drop down should say\nAny. Set Nature to what the Pokemon you received had. In my case\nit's Timid.\nYou may also input a Gender, if your Pokemon can be multiple\ndifferent ones.\nOnce you select a Nature, the IV Calculator function will appear.\n\nThe IV Calculator wants you to input your Pokemons level, then\nstats. If it is highlighted red at all, that means you've made a typo\nor forgot to enter something.\n\n\nIf you have Rare Candies to raise the Pokemon's level, we can make the\nIV Ranges even more Precise. We aren't keeping this Pokemon, so it's\nsafe to use them to gain info. They will come back when we soft reset!\nTo account for the extra level, push the Enter/Return button on your\nkeyboard, and a new row to enter the information for its next level will\nappear.\n\n\nOnce you finish entering them, the IV Filters in Calibration\nwill be populated with a range of potential stats of your Pokemon.\nAt this point, hit Submit. You should only get one result. If you\nget more than that, you can narrow down the results further by doing\nmore levels in the IV Calculator.\n\nThis is the Oddish I hit! I was about 350 Advances late. I'll update Eon\nTimer accordingly, and try again.\nReminder: If you hit 0 results, check Wild Methods 2 &amp; 4, your Pokemon\ncould be hiding there!\n\nAt this point it's rinse and repeat. Eventually, with enough tries,\nyou'll hit your target Pokemon! This particular Natu took me 6 attempts.\n\nGenerally, the hard part of this Manip is learning how pathing works &amp;\nhow to do map refreshing. They are techniques that are only really used\nin Ruby &amp; Sapphire. (although there are some use cases in FR/LG\n&amp; Emerald, but they are few and far between)\nIt also might seem like a lot to do this just for some shinies which\ncould be easily obtained in Emerald with battle record, but the real\npurpose of this is to set you up for our Advanced courses, which\nwill make heavy use of Map Refreshing.\nNext Steps...\nAt this point you're all done with the Intermediate course! Next up is\nAdvanced. In there we'll cover some complex, multi step Manips that will\nfocus on not only getting SHINY Pokemon, but Pokemon with good stats.

Bring a Pokemon that\nknows rock smash with you.\n\nIn the final room, there will be tons of breakable rocks. Each time you\nbreak a rock, there's a chance you get a fossil. So break all of the\nrocks in the room. If you get no old ambers, leave the room and\nre-enter, all the rocks will respawn. Repeat until you have at least 2.\nThis can take a while! So put on a youtube video or movie and grind\naway.\n\nEach manip you do will require you use 2 old ambers, but only\npermanently consumes 1. So, the amount of old ambers you need depends on\nhow many manips you intend to do!\n \nORAS\n \nTo farm Fossils in ORAS, you first need the Eon Flute unlocked, so you can Soar on the Latios/Latias across Hoenn. \nWhen you're in the sky, random \"Mirage Spots\" or \"Mirage Islands\" appear. On some of them, you can find Smashable Rocks that can contain fossils.\nYou can find them on the Mirage Island south of\nPacifidlog\ntown\n\nAs well as the Mirage island south of Route\n134.\n\nThese may not spawn every day, so if one of them is there, make sure to\nget as many fossils as you can.\nEach time you break a rock, there's a chance you get a fossil. So break\nall of the rocks on the Island. If you get no old ambers, leave the\nIsland and re-enter, all the rocks will respawn.

And we use the IVs to determine what seed\nwe're on!\nUnfortunately, getting a ton of rare candies is not very easy. We also\ndon't have an exact amount of candies we need. Every Pokemon is\ndifferent, which means it might take a different amount of rare candies\neach time to get the IVs of a given Aerodactyl. In addition, every RNG\nManip will permanently consume about 3 to 5 rare candies, so we'll have\nto replenish our stash occasionally.\nConservatively, I aim for 50 rare candies if I'm fully out. But you can\nget more if you want.\nRecommended Setup\nIn-Game Requirements\n\nHave beaten the Elite 4(Blissey Base Section Only)\n\nThe Guide\nHidden Items\nThere's two main techniques we can use. However, before you use either\nof them, make sure to pickup every rare candy that is lying on the\nground in the game.\n\nThese videos by Tarx 96 showcase where they are\n\n\nXY\n\n\nORAS\n\n\nThe two methods are:\n\n\nPokemon Bank\n\n\nPickup Farming\n\n\nEach method has its pros and cons. I'll begin with Pokemon bank.\nPokemon Bank\nPokemon Bank passively generates Poké Miles each day, based on how many\nPokemon you have stored in it, at a rate of 1 Poké Mile per 30 Pokemon\nper day, with the fractional remainder carried over to the next day!\nPoké Miles are (mostly) useless nowadays, but you can also choose to\nreceive your Poké Miles as Battle Points (BP) instead, at a rate of 1 BP\nfor every 10 Poké Miles you have. Every single BP you have MUST be sent\nto ONE game, and you can use them to buy rare candies at the Battle\nMaison in that game.\n\nRare candies are 48 BP Each, which is a lot, but bank can really rack up\na TON of BP overtime, if you wait.\n\nThe pros:\n\n\nIf you have a very full bank, you'll likely be generating multiple\nrare candies per day. I personally am getting at least one.\n\n\nYou don't have to do anything other than wait. It's passive income!\n\n\nThe Cons:\n\n\nBank is unavailable for download, so if you don't have it installed\non your 3DS already, you can't get it.\n\n\nIt's slow if you don't have a lot of Pokemon. So if you transferred\nmost of your collection to home, this might not benefit you.\n\n\nEven if you have a lot of Pokemon, this is not an active method.\nMeaning, the only way to farm more is to wait days.\n\n\nYou can only send your entire accumulated amount to one game. So if\nyou only want to manip one target, it might be overkill!\n\n\nIt's only available in the post-game, as you need access to the\nBattle Maison to spend your BP!\n\n\nBank WILL shutdown someday, so this method will not always work.\n\n\nDespite the seemingly overwhelming amount of cons, this is my preferred\nmethod. I only do gen 6 RNG Manips occasionally, so by the time I'm\nready for a new manip, I have a ton of BP ready to send to whichever\ngame I need!\nThat said, if this technique is not for you, maybe pickup farming is!\nPickup Farming\nPickup farming is pretty simple. Get 5 to 6 Pokemon with the ability\npickup to level 41 or higher, then repeatedly win wild battles to try\nand get the ability to happen.\n\nPickup has a 10% chance to give you an item from this table. The percent\neach item has is how likely you are to get that item if pickup triggers.\n\nTable from bulbapedia\n\nThis is the pickup table from ORAS, but what we care about remains the\nsame between them and XY: Rare candies.\n\nFrom level 41 onwards, you have a 10% chance to get a rare candy, if\npickup triggers.\nXY &amp; ORAS have slightly different methods for pickup farming preparation, so click the tab for the game you're playing. \n\nXY\n First, we have to get our Pokemon with the ability pickup. Bunnelby can be found on Route 1 &amp; is extremely common, &amp; its evolution retains the ability, so I recommend it. \nOnce you pick your Pokemon, catch 6 of them. \nYou now have to level the Pokemon to 41. \nFor quick leveling, you can do rotation battles in Restaurant Le Wow in Lumiose City.\nThere's an audino in that group, and you'll easily get them to level 40\nin one battle if you have the EXP Share on and the EXP O Power.\nYou'll also need to bring at least one strong Pokemon to carry the rotation battles. This means we can only level 5 Bunnelby at a time.\nI can never remember how to navigate this place, so I always use the\nTaxi to get there. It's under \"Fine Dining\" in the taxi menu.\n\nAnd here's which battle to select\n\n \nORAS\n \nFirst, we have to get our Pokemon with the ability pickup. Zigzagoon, can be found on Route 101 &amp; is extremely common, &amp; its evolution retains the ability, so I recommend it. \nOnce you pick your Pokemon, catch 6 of them. \nYou now have to level the Pokemon to 41. \nTo do this, we have to set up some Blissey Bases via these QR Codes:\n\n\n\nThe first image explains how they work and where they are. This will\nalso get you zigzagoons to be above 40 in 1 battle.\n \n\nOnce you have 6 Pickup Pokemon at level 41 or higher, you can proceed to\n\nGet into a battle\nKO a Wild Pokemon\nCheck your pickup items\nRepeat until you have 40+ rare candies!\n\nI recommend doing this on Route 1 or 101 depending on your game. \nThe Pros:\n\nEasy &amp; Mindless. You can just do this while watching TV or movies.\nNot tied to an online service\nTechnically not post-game\n\nThe Cons:\n\nVery slow\nActive, you HAVE to be on your DS doing this.\n\nOn paper, this looks a lot better than bank, but I really do not enjoy\nthe tedium it introduces into the mix. However, if you're used to shiny\nhunting, maybe this will be easier for you to stomach.\nAnd those are all the techniques I know of to farm for rare candies!\nChoose whichever method suits you, and hopefully it won't be long before\nyou're ready to RNG Manip in gen 6!\nNext Steps...\nIf you're prepping for ORAS RNG Manipulation, there's a good chance\nyou'll need some Fossils, which is the previous guide in extra credit!\nSo check that out if you need them.\nOtherwise, hopefully you're ready to manip.

ORAS Also needs to have the\nEon Flute unlocked so you can soar over the map.\nThat's because the seed finding process is to revive two Aerodactyl and\nlearn their exact IVs using an IV Calculator.\nIf you're unsure of the best way to get these items, check out our\nExtra Credit\nguides on them. It can be easier than it sounds!\n\n\nOld Amber Finding Guide\n\n\n\nRare Candy Farming\nGuide\n\n\nOnce you've got these items, pick which Fossil you're going to Manip. In\nthis guide, I'll be going for a Shiny Aerodactyl. Once you know who your\ntarget is, toss or sell every other fossil aside from Old Amber and your\ntarget. This will minimize the menuing you have to do.\nFinding your Seed\nThere's two types of initial seed searching in Gen 6. Full search, and\nQuick search. A Full search uses two Aerodactyls IVs to find the Initial\nSeed you received them on.\nOnce you know your first seed, you can then do Quick Searches every time\nyou soft reset from then on until you save the game. This is because a\nportion of the seed is determined by various factors from when you last\nsaved the game, which makes the initial seed more easily predicted when you know\nthe previous seed.\nSo, to find our seed, we need to first do a Full Search, and then when\nwe have the seed, we can do Quick Searches repeatedly until we catch the\nPokemon we want.\nFull Search\nTo do a Full Search, you're going to need to have two Old Ambers and be\nsaved right here, in front of the person who revives fossils.\nIt's this person in XY in Ambrette town, near the entrance to\nglittering cave:\n\nAnd this person in ORAS, in Rustboro City, in the DevonCorp building:\n\nFor the rest of the guide, I'll be using XY, but the process is the same\nbetween both games!\nYou may use the IV Calculator of your choosing, but I'll use metalkids\niv\ncalculator.\nI opened two instances in my browser.\nWe want the calculators ready to go once we receive our two Aerodactyl,\nso it's best to set them up beforehand.\nTo set them up, we need to select our species (Aerodactyl) and set the\ndefault level to 20.\nIn addition, push the button that says \"Add\" to add some more rows to\nthe calculator.\n\nOnce that's done, open Eontimer and go to the 3 tab, and select Variable\nTimer from the dropdown.\n\nNext, click the settings cog on the lower left to open up Eontimers\nsettings. In there, go to the \"Timer\" tab and set the Console dropdown\nto \"Custom\" and the Custom Framerate box to \"16.71\".\n\nAt this point, save your game and then soft reset (L+R+START+SELECT) and\nget to your game's title screen.\n\nX\n \n \nY\n \n\n \nOR\n \n\n \nAS\n \n \n\n\n  Tip: Continuing past the title\n  In XY, once you soft reset you're immediately at the title screen and any button press will continue the game. \n\nIn ORAS, you have to push A or Start once to skip the intro to get to the title screen to continue.\n\nOnce you're on the title screen, you want to hit A to continue &amp; hit\nStart on Eontimer at the same time. Eontimer will begin counting up.\n\nOnce you've loaded into the overworld, move as quickly as possible to\nreceive both Aerodactyl.\nJust mash A, and when the person disappears and reappears, start mashing\nB to avoid the \"Nickname\" Prompt, and you can then continue mashing A to\nreceive the second Aerodactyl.\n\nOnce you've got both Aerodactyl, we're going to calculate their IVs.\nLook at the first Aerodactyl you received's summary screen, and check\nits Nature. Put that into the IV Calculator. None of the other info in\nthe dropdowns matters.\n\n\nAfter that, input its level 20 stats and hit calculate.\n\n\nYou will be given a range of possible IVs, and the next helpful level\nfor you to gain more knowledge on that specific IV.\nLevel Aerodactyl up using a rare candy and record its stats into the next row of the calculator. Do this until all the stats only have one potential outcome for the IVs. \nFor my first\nAerodactyl, I had level it to 24.\n\n\nRepeat this process in the exact same way for your second Aerodactyl.\nThis one took me until level 26.\n\n\nI find this is about the average experience for Aerodactyl. In some\ncases, though, the next helpful level might be really high, like 50, or\n100. In those cases if I don't have enough rare candies, I just reset\nthe game. Otherwise it will still work fine.\nOnce you have both IVs known, open up Poke6-seed-finder. It'll ask you\nfor the IVs of \"Wild 1\", which is your first Aerodactyl. It has some\ndefault values here, so you'll have to backspace them to enter yours.\nAfter you enter the IVs, it will ask for a frame range. It's roughly\nwhat RNG Advance you received the Aerodactyls on. This varies\ndepending on your game!\n\n\nXY: 750-900\n\n\nORAS: 600-800 (Default value)\n\n\nFor some reason, erasing the frames section for your own value is a\nbit finicky. I use the arrow keys to move the cursor around to delete\nthe numbers I need to replace.\n\nOnce you hit enter, it will ask for the same things, but for the second\nAerodactyl.\nThe frame range of the second Aerodactyl also varies based on game.\n\n\nXY: 1500-1900\n\n\nORAS: 1500-1700(Default value)\n\n\n\nOnce you hit enter here, it'll ask for another range. Just leave it at\nits default value and hit enter. A search will now begin. This should\nonly take one to two minutes to complete.\n\nAlmost every time there will only be one result. If you get two on your\nfirst ever manip, just reset and start from Full Search\n\n  Note: What to do if I have more than 1 seed?\n  If you have more than one seed, and you've done an RNG Manip in this\ngame before, the best way to tell is by looking at what frames it says\nyour Pokemon were received at. If you just mash as fast as you can,\nyou'll be pretty consistent.\n\nFor example, in this guide I hit 850 on frame 1, and 1851 on frame 2. I\nam very rarely more than 20 frames earlier or later than that. So if I\nhad two results, one with a frame 1 of 850, and another with a frame 1\nof 900, I would discard the 900 result as a false positive.\n\nOnce you get the result, we're going to immediately move on to the Quick\nSearch.\nDo not soft reset yet, and do not stop Eon Timer yet!\nQuick Search\nThe quick search works similarly to the Full Search, but we only use\n1 Aerodactyl and we don't need its exact IVs, just a small range.\nHowever, we can only do it after a Full Search, because one of the\nparameters we need to do a Quick Search is our previous initial seed.\nTo do a quick search, we will use, Gen 6 GPU Tools. Open it up and click the IV Search tab.\nThen, from the \"Select Platform\" dropdown, pick your Graphics Card\nManufacturer, and from the \"Select Device\" dropdown, pick your\ngraphics card.\nLastly, for the Pokemon 1 Advance Range, set it according to your\ngame, just like we did the Full Search.\n\n\nXY: 750-900\n\n\nORAS: 600-800 (Default value)\n\n\n\nLastly, place the seed you got from Poke6-seed-finder into the Base\nSeed box.\n\nAt this point, we're ready for Quick Search! Look at EonTimer, which\nshould still be running, and note how many seconds it's at.\n\nMine was around 5 minutes. Then, soft reset your game &amp; stop eontimer.\nThen, at the Title Screen, hit A to continue and hit Start on Eontimer\nat the same time.\nJust like with the Full Search, receive an Aerodactyl\nas quickly as you can.\nOnce you have, click the \"Calculate IVs\" button, and a new window will\npop up. This IV Calculator works differently than normal ones, so I'll\nexplain this as well.\nThe top dropdown is for nature, so select whichever one your Aerodactyl\nhas.\n\n\nAfter that, type out all the Aerodactyls stats, but not Level into the\nbox, then hit confirm. If you didn't make any mistakes, you'll get a\nsmall range of IVs. If something says \"Invalid\", it means you typed a\nstat incorrectly.\n\nWhile we don't need exact IVs, leveling Aerodactyl up a bit will give us\nless potential results, which makes us more certain our seed is the\ncorrect one.\nThe next level is different, as you only have to input the stats that\nyou get from leveling up.\n\n\nI ended up going to level 23 before hitting the \"Confirm\" button.\n\n\nThis will close the IV Calculator and put your IV Range in the main\nwindow. At this point, click Find Seed.\n\nIt may take a moment, but you should get many potential results.\n\nThere's a few things that are helpful to narrow down which one is our\nseed.\n\n\nTime. In the parenthesis is how many hours, minutes, and seconds\nwould have passed for the \"Base Seed\" you gave gen6gpu tools to get to\nthe seed next to that amount of time. This is why I had you run EonTimer\nand record how long it took you until you reset the game. As you can\nsee in this example, the nearest seed is 5 minutes and 53 seconds,\nand I had eontimer at about 5 minutes. The second closest possible\nseed is over 40 minutes away! So it's not possible that that is my\nseed.\n\n\nNext to the time is Advances. The seed that I suspect is mine, with\nthe 6 minute time, is at advance 855. This is about the advance I\nhit for the first Aerodactyl from the \"Full Search\". The other\nadvances are far too early.\n\n\nIn short, the seed you hit should be whichever is closest in time to\nyour Eontimer from full search, and the advance of your first Aerodactyl\nin full search.\nOnce you have that, open 3DSRNGTool so we can begin our first attempt!\n\nFirst Attempt\nIn 3DSRNGTool click the Stationary Tab and in Stationary\nSettings, select Fossil from the Category Dropdown, and pick\nwhichever fossil you're manipping from the Pokemon Dropdown.\nIn Filters, check the Shiny Only box.\nSelect your Profile in the Profile dropdown. This will automatically\nfill out your TSV and Game Version.\nPaste your Seed from Gen 6 GPU Tools in the Seed Box. You can\ncopy it by highlighting it, then using control+c on the keyboard.\nAlso, check the Advanced Box.\nAfter that, hit calculate, you should get a decent amount of results.\n\nTo pick a target, what we're going to look at is the Real Time column,\nand compare that value to EonTimers current time.\nAt this point for me, EonTimer was at 200 seconds.\n\n  Tip: How many seconds?\n  It's handy to remember that 1 minute is 60 seconds, 2 is 120, 3 is\n180, 4 is 240, 5 is 300, and 6 is 360.\n\n\nThis is about 3 and a half minutes of time. This means 2 things.\n\n\nAll of the options in Real Time before 3 and a half minutes are now\nuntargetable for this attempt.\n\n\nThe faster you find your seed and set up 3DSRNGTool, the more\noptions you'll have for a target Pokemon.\n\n\n\nSince I'm just going for a quick shiny, I'll choose the next available\noption on Frame 17207.\nIn 3DSRNGTool, I'll right click the frame and then click \"Set as Target\nFrame\", which will update the Target Frame box in 3DSRNGTool.\n\nThen, I'll also put that frame value into EonTimer, and click Set Target\nFrame.\n\nEontimer will now begin counting down towards your target instead, and\nall the boxes where you could enter values in will be greyed out.\n\nWe now want to get to the final dialogue box. For fossils, it's this\ndialogue box:\n\n\nThe name will be whatever fossil you chose.\nThen, when Eontimer gets near the end of its countdown, it will beep 6\ntimes. The goal is to press A on the 6th beep to receive your fossil.\n\nWe can see it's not Shiny like I wanted. It's also likely you missed\nyour target. We're going to have to figure out what RNG Advance we\nlanded on and adjust our timing.\n\n  Note: Frames Vs Advances\n  Frames and Advances are often used interchangeably across RNG documentation, guides, and tools.\n\nFrames is a commonly used term to describe game-state intervals in Speedrunning and Fighting Games. Updating video game logic every visual frame is a common practice, and this is generally how it works for Generation 6's main RNG.\n\nThese games in particular have pretty severe issues with lag. Meaning, the RNG can slowdown to a crawl, even if the visuals look okay.\n\nAnd,in other games this isn’t always the case. The frames you visually see might be completely separate from the game’s logic. RNG Advances accurately describes what’s happening, no matter the situation.\n\nCalibration &amp; Lag\nTo find where we actually landed, open 3DSRNGTool and in the Filters\nsection, uncheck Shiny Only and click Using Stats.\nFrom there, enter your Fossils current stats and click calculate. You\nshould get only one result.\n\nIn the Shift/F column, you'll see how early or late you were compared to\nyour target frame.\nA minus (-) before the number means you were early, a plus (+) means you were late.\nI was 557 early. It's not uncommon to be extremely early or late on your\nfirst attempt, and that's because of 1 thing:\n\nLag. These games are not quite able to consistently hold their target\nframerate, and this means that your results for how early or late you\nare can vary wildly based on a few factors.\n\n\nHow long you wait. The framerate of 16.71 (59.84 frames per second)\nis not quite correct for EonTimer. However, no framerate has been\nfound that is exactly accurate. This means that over time, EonTimer desyncs from our games framerate.\n\n\nMoving throughout the overworld. Running from one area to another,\nwhich is required in these games, often generates lag, or pauses the\nrng temporarily in various ways. Meaning no calibration you use will\nwork for every single manip.\n\n\n\n  Note: What is the framerate?\n  The current best estimated framerate is 59.84 frames per second, but\nthis is not 100% accurate. In fact, the game has two different frame\nrates. One for the overworld, where the game goes 2 by 2 mode, which is\naround 30 fps. The other one is for the bag, which is 60 fps but 1 by\n1 mode.\n\nIn addition, each time you open a menu or enter a new area the game pauses for a period of time, meaning things are different for every single manip, since you're rarely going to the same place. \n\nAll of this means that, at the moment, there is an inherent instability in this generations RNG Manips.\n\nTo combat this is on our next attempt we will add 557 to our\ntarget frame.\nBecause of the framerate not being correct, this calibration won't work\nfor target frames significantly earlier or later than our target for\nthis attempt.\nI have found it's decently stable for +-100 Frames.\nFor example, my current target was 17207. If I had a target anywhere\nfrom 17100-17300, give or take, I would add 557 to it before inputting\nit into EonTimers Target Frame box.\nI'll open a notepad doc, and write down that frame and what calibration\nit was at.\n\nThere is also one additional pain point to cover.\nEvens Vs Odds\nWhile the main RNG in this game moves at around 59.84 frames per second,\nstrangely, it does this by running the game at 29.92 fps and skipping over every other rng state.\nThis means the RNG effectively going 2 by 2 and giving the illusion that it's running at 60fps~. However,\nwhenever you're in a sub-menu, like the item or party menus, the game\nstops behaving this way, and goes 1 by 1 at the expected 59.84 fps.\nThe consequence of this is, sometimes, at random, your target frame will\nbe unhittable, because you'll be on an even sequence while targeting an\nodd frame, or vice versa.\nAnd because we go into a sub-menu to check the Aerodactyls IVs, we have\nno way to know which of these sequences we're in.\nThis is just something to keep in mind. So, if you're off by only 1\nframe, there's nothing you could've done about it.\nAt this point, we're ready for try number 2!\nSecond Attempt &amp; Further Calibration\nSoft reset the game, and find your seed again using the steps from\nQuick Search, and set up 3DSRNGTool just like we did in First Attempt, but with your new seed.\nHowever, for me, there was no Shiny Target within -+100 of my\ncalibration.\n\nIn this scenario, what you do is pick the closest target to that\ncalibration, in my case it was 17796, and use that calibration anyway.\nSo, I add 557 to it and put it into EonTimer.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to right click your target &amp; click Set as target\nframe in 3DSRNGTool.\n\nContinue the attempt as we did in the First Attempt, and receive your\nfossil. If your second target was within the -+100, you may have gotten\nyour shiny!\nIf not, enter your Pokemons stats into 3DSRNGTool and find where you\nlanded.\n\nI was only 13 frames early, which is actually pretty close! But\nremember, I added 557 to this before I input it into EonTimer.\nSo, I'll add 13 to 557, since I was still early, and write down in my\nnotes that for a target frame of 17783, I have to add 570.\n\nAnd this is the entire process.\n\n\nFind your seed\n\n\nFind a target closest to one of your calibrations\n\n\nUse said calibration to make an attempt\n\n\nIf you fail, add a new calibration to your list.\n\n\nThe benefit of this is that over time, you gain a more precise\ncalibration, and each time you do an attempt, you have a new available\ntarget frame.\nThe obvious downside is how tedious it can be.\nJust have patience, trust the process, and repeat from Quick Search\nuntil you eventually get your shiny!\nI only ended up having to do 4 attempts for my Aerodactyl.\n\n\n  Note: Some tips\n  XY/ORAS RNG, even a basic one like this, can be quite tedious. However,\nwith enough patience you'll get your calibration down.\n\nDon't be afraid to just soft reset and immediately find your seed again\nonce you've got a decent pile of calibrations. You will be able to just\ncheck if there's a target nearby, if not, reset and try again.\n\nNext Steps...\nOnce you get a shiny this way, you fully understand the basics of\nXY/ORAS RNG Manips. In the next guide, I'll explain how we reset for\nspecific IV static encounters and the nature of synchronize!\n","description":"Learn the basics of Gen 6 RNG by getting a quick shiny!","id":"https://retailrng.com/xyoras/beginner/basic-manip/","title":"XY/ORAS Basic Shiny Manip"},"https://retailrng.com/xyoras/beginner/tsv-find/":{"body":"Overview\nWhile not necessary for every single RNG Manip, if you want to get\nShinies, you'll need to know your TSV.\nAny TSV can get any combination of IVs/Nature shiny, so we don't need to\nworry about getting a specific one.\nWhat we'll cover in this guide is how to find your current save files\nTSV via a Chain Fishing Shiny Hunt.\nIt will also function as a basic introduction to the process and tools\nwe use to RNG Manip in these games, as in order to find your TSV, we\nneed to know our initial seed, and what frame our Shiny appeared on.\nIf you're not interested in any shinies, the next guide will still cover\nthe basics, so feel free to skip ahead.\nRecommended Setup\nHardware Requirements\n\n\nPokemon X/Y/OR/AS\n\n\nWindows 10/11 PC\n\n\nIn-Game Requirements\n\n\nAt least 2 Old Amber\n\n\nAt least 50 Rare Candy\n\n\nText speed set to fast\n\n\nA Pokemon with the suction cups or sticky hold ability\n\n\nSuper Rod\n\n\nPokeballs to catch the shiny\n\n\nPokémon to aid in capture, such as a false swipe user or a\nspore user.\n\n\nTwo free spaces in your party\n\n\nSmoke Ball (not 100% required, but helpful)\n\n\nA Pokemon with fly\n\n\nA Pokemon with surf(ORAS only)\n\n\nHave Eon Flute (ORAS Only)\n\n\nTools Used\n\n\npoke6-seed-finder\n\n\n3DS RNG\nTool\n\n\nIV\nCalculator\n\n\nVideo Examples\n\nim a blisy\n._.\n\nThe Guide\nThe Setup\nYou may have noticed in the requirements it's suggested that you have at\nleast 2 Old Amber and 50 Rare candies. ORAS Also needs to have the Eon Flute unlocked so you can soar over the map. \nThat's because the seed finding process is to revive two Aerodactyl and\nlearn their exact IVs using an IV Calculator. \nIf you're unsure of the best way to get these items, check out our Extra\nCredit guides on them. It can be easier than it sounds!\n\n\nOld Amber Finding Guide\n\n\nRare Candy Farming Guide\n\n\nOnce you've got the required items, make sure to set up your party with:\n\n\nSuction Cup User in the Lead(mine held the smoke ball to runaway\neasily)\n\n\nA Pokemon with fly\n\n\nA Pokemon with surf(ORAS Only)\n\n\nIn addition, I registered the Super Rod in the bag, and deregistered all\nother Items. So when I hit Y, the menu to use a key item doesn't pop up,\nit just does the super rod immediately.\nI also set the text speed to fast.\nAt this point you're ready to go, so we can begin the Seed Search!\nFull Search\nFirst things first, head to the person who revives fossils in your game\nIt's this person in XY in Ambrette town, near the entrance to glittering\ncave:\n\nAnd this person in ORAS, in Rustboro City, in the DevinCorp building:\n\nI would also recommend getting rid of any other Fossil you may have by\nreviving it before doing this RNG, or selling it at a shop. This is so\nyou do not have to navigate a menu to pick the Old Amber.\nAt this point, save your game and then soft reset (L+R+START+SELECT) and\nget to your game's title screen.\nOnce you're on the title screen, you want to hit A to continue past it,\nand move as quickly as possible to receive both Aerodactyl.\nJust mash A, and when the person disappears and reappears, start mashing\nB to avoid the \"Nickname\" Prompt, and you can then continue mashing A to\nreceive the second Aerodactyl.\n\nOnce you've got both Aerodactyl, we're going to calculate their IVs.\nYou may use the IV Calculator of your choosing, but I'll use metalkids\niv\ncalculator.\nTo set up the calculator, we need to select our species (Aerodactyl) and\nset the default level to 20.\n\nIn addition, push the add row button to add 5 more levels.\n\nAfter that, check your first Aerodactyls nature and input it in the\ndropdown.\n\nThen, check its level 20 stats, and input them into the first row of the\ncalculator, and hit calculate.\n\n\nYou'll see the results on the bottom, which will all be a range of\npotential values. In addition, it will tell you the \"next helpful\nlevel\"\n\nThis is the next level that will reduce the range of IVs. Use rare\ncandies until the IVs are reduced to 1 value each.\nThis first one took me until level 26 to be fully deduced.\n\n\nOnce that's done, repeat in the exact same way for the second\nAerodactyl. Reminder, the IVs for BOTH must be exact, and have no\nranges.\nThe second Aerodactyl took until it was level 28 to fully deduce the\nIVs.\n\n\nAfter you have both IVs fully deduced, open poke-6-seed-finder. It'll\nask you for the IVs of the first Aerodactyl, so input your results. It\nhas some default values there, so you'll have to backspace them.\nAfter you enter the IVs, it will ask for a frame range. It's roughly\nwhat RNG Advance you received the Aerodactyls on. This varies\ndepending on your game!\n\n\nXY: 750-900\n\n\nORAS: 600-800 (Default value)\n\n\nFor some reason, erasing the frames section for your own value is a\nbit finicky. I use the arrow keys to move the cursor around to delete\nthe numbers I need to replace.\n\n\nOnce you hit enter, it will ask for the same things, but for the second\nAerodactyl.\nThe frame range of the second Aerodactyl also varies based on game.\n\n\nXY: 1500-1900\n\n\nORAS: 1500-1700(Default value)\n\n\n\n\n\n  Note: Frames Vs Advances\n  Frames and Advances are often used interchangeably across RNG documentation, guides, and tools.\n\nFrames is a commonly used term to describe game-state intervals in Speedrunning and Fighting Games. Updating video game logic every visual frame is a common practice, and this is generally how it works for Generation 6's main RNG.\n\nThese games in particular have pretty severe issues with lag. Meaning, the RNG can slowdown to a crawl, even if the visuals look okay.\n\nAnd,in other games this isn’t always the case. The frames you visually see might be completely separate from the game’s logic. RNG Advances accurately describes what’s happening, no matter the situation.\n\nOnce you hit enter here, it'll ask for another range. Just leave it at\nits default value and hit enter. A search will now begin. This should\nonly take one to two minutes to complete.\n\nAlmost every time there will only be one result. For this tutorial, if\nyou get two, just redo this process.\nOnce you have your singular result, it's time to chain fish for a shiny!\n\nChain Fishing\nIn order to find your TSV, we need a shiny. Normally, this could take a\nlot of resets (which is one of the reasons you may want to learn how to\nrng manip!), but Chain Fishing is a really quick &amp; easy way to find a\nshiny.\nAll you have to do is continuously reel in Pokemon from a fishing rod\nwithout:\n\n\nMoving from your fishing spot\n\n\nReeling in too slow\n\n\nReeling in too fast\n\n\nNot getting a nibble\n\n\nYou can KO, Catch, or Runaway from the encounter and the chain still\ngoes up.\nOnce you've got 20 reel ins, you're at max shiny odds, which is about 1\nin 100.\nThe only real threat is the \"Not even a nibble...\" message, but we'll be\nmitigating the chance of doing that with two things.\n\n\nA Pokemon with suction cups or sticky hold at the lead of your\nparty. This ability increases the likelihood of a reel in on a\nfishing rod.\n\n\nFishing in a tile completely surrounded by rocks. This also does\nwhat sticky hold does, and they stack on top of eachother.\n\n\nI'll show the two locations I used. I'll also remind you to use the\nsuper rod, because Pokemon spawned using it will be high enough level\nwhere we don't need to use rare candies to figure out their IVs.\nFly to one of these locations immediately after you start the seed search. \nXY Fishing Location, North of Shalour City:\n\nORAS Fishing Location, South of the entrance to Victory Road:\n\nIf you've done this before, any fishing spot like this will work fine,\nit doesn't have to be the examples I've shown.\nAt this point, catch the first non-shiny you see. We'll use it for\nseed verification later. If you find a shiny first encounter, just reel\nin until you get a non-shiny and catch that.\nThen, just shiny hunt! It shouldn't take too long. I did runaways by putting a Smoke Ball on my Suction Cups Pokemon.\n\nI found a shiny octillery in 20 Casts.\nIn ORAS it took me about 40 casts to find a Shiny Luvdisc, but that was\nstill only 25 minutes!\nNow that we have our shinies, we can find what our TSV is!\nTSV Search\nFirst, we'll check the IVs of both Pokemon we caught, both shiny and non\nshiny.\nThis time they don't need to be exact, though. Just whatever level they\nare at will do.\nHere's the non-shiny.\n\n\nAnd here's the shiny.\n\n\nNow, we're going to open 3DSRNGTool.\nIn here, switch to the Wild Tab, and select your game from the\ndropdown.\n\nFirst things first, paste the result from poke6-seed-search into the\nSeed box.\nAfter that, in the Wild Encounter Settings, we're going to change a\nfew things to set up for fishing.\nCategory should be Fishing.\nPokemon should be Super Rod\nLocation should be wherever you fished, in my case it was\nShalour City.\nLead should be Suction Cups | Sticky Hold, if you used it.\nAnd despite having a chain of some amount, make sure Chain Length is\nset to 0.\nThen, in the RNG Info section, set the Frame Range to 0 -&gt;\n5000000.\nAlso, even if you have the Shiny Charm, do NOT check the Shiny Charm\nbox.\n\nNow, in the Filters section, input the range of IVs from your\nnon-shiny encounter. Also, check the Advanced Box on the upper\nleft of the program.\nThen, click calculate. You should get a few results.\n\nWe can see I have two results. To know which one is potentially ours, we can look at a few things. Firstly, is the Real Time column. You can see it says about 8 minutes there. That's how long this Pokemon took AFTER hitting A on the title screen to appear. 8ish minutes seems right to me. Compare that to the other result, which is 10 hours. \nThe amount of time you should expect here will vary based on how long\nyou took to get over there and fish.\nThe reason we're checking this non-shiny catch is because it reduces the amount of false positives. If we have the non shiny at a lower real time value, then the shiny at a higher one that's not too long after it, it's safe to rule out a false positive.\nAnyway, once we've confirmed the non-shiny appears on the seed you hit, enter the IV range for the shiny.\n\nThis time it sas 19 minutes, which again makes sense to me based on when\nI caught the shiny!\nYou now have your TSV! It's the PSV of the Shiny!\n\nNow that you know your TSV, let's set up a profile so you don't lose it.\nAlso, if you don't care about this shiny you caught &amp; want to save the\nrare candies, you can soft reset over it.\nSetting up a Profile\nSetting up a profile in 3DSRNGTool will preserve a few attributes about\nthat particular save file in the program, so you don't lose your TSV &amp;\nhave to do this again.\nTo do so, click the options dropdown, and click profile manager.\n\nThen, in profile manager, click the + button.\n\nA new window will pop up. In the Description box, I usually put the\ngames OT &amp; ID.\nIn the GameVersion dropdown, select your game.\nAnd enter the TSV we just found in the TSV box.\nIf you have the shiny charm, also check that box now. We only had it\nunchecked for TSV Finding.\n\nAnd that's it! You now have your TSV so you can RNG Manipulate Shinies\nvia Gen 6 RNG Manipulation, and along the way you got a basic\nunderstanding of the Initial Seed Finding process!\nThe one big drawback to this method is that you cannot deduce your\nTRV from it. TRV in combination with your TSV is your\nEXACT TID/SID.\nThis information is only useful if you're looking to RNG Manipulate\nSquare Shinies in Sword &amp; Shield specifically, as they don't exist\nelsewhere.\nYou can use your TSV to find your TRV, but that won't be covered\nin this guide, as it's a lengthy process.\nNext Steps...\nSince this wasn't an actual RNG Manip, I suggest trying our next\nbeginner guide out, which will cover how to get a Quick Shiny Fossil\nto teach you the basics of RNG Manipulation in these games.\n","description":"How to find your Trainer Shiny Value via
